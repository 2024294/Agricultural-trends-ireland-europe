Part of this is due to government and EU subsidies that made it most profitable to have dairy cows instead of other types of farming.\n\nPeople think agriculture is more important to our economy than it actually is, so I'd say it'll be a long time before there's a real push to step back from dairy farming.\n\nThere's a bit more context on the recent history of agriculture in this article: https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/jun/06/food-will-be-a-by-product-the-irish-farmers-creating-nature-friendly-fields""]",0.13464912280701755,0.40520050125313284,1

Weston/Loblaws are the largest FOOD MONOPOLY IN CANADA AND THEY HAVE THE MOST CONTROL OVER FOOD PRICES.  

Look how many Sugar Companies they own... Bakeries, Cooking Oil, Clothing, Pharma, Health, Agriculture...

The Canadian branch of the Weston family currently owns or controls over 200 companies.

There are Weston UK, USA, and Ireland branches as well. 

Add Bread Price Fixing To The Mix

Donations to the UK Parliament Parties n 2010, the Charity Commission found that between 1993 and 2004 Weston charity had given donations to the UK Conservative Party that totalled £900,000, which were in breach of UK charity law; as were similar donations to the economically liberal think tank the Centre for Policy Studies, and to Eurosceptic European political lobby groups such as the European Foundation and the Labour Euro-Safeguards Campaign.

"Open Letter to Steve Huffman and the Board of Directors of Reddit, Inc– If you believe in standing up to hate and supporting black lives, you need to act",29146,AgainstHateSubreddits,https://www.reddit.com/r/AgainstHateSubreddits/comments/gyyqem/open_letter_to_steve_huffman_and_the_board_of/,1591620657.0,"**Open Letter to Steve Huffman and the Board of Directors of Reddit, Inc – If you believe in standing up to hate and supporting black lives, you need to act**

Dear Steve,

On June 1, you shared a letter on Reddit’s blog  [“Remember the Human – Black Lives Matter”]( https://redditblog.com/2020/06/01/remember-the-human-black-lives-matter/).  In this letter, you claim “as Snoos, we do not tolerate hate, racism, and violence, and while we have work to do to fight these on our platform, our values are clear.”

As of today, neither you nor any other Reddit admins have shared this letter anywhere on reddit.com. However, [the response to this message was swift on Twitter](https://twitter.com/reddit/status/1267643352851247106), where you were rightfully labeled as hypocritical based on your long and well-recorded history of defending racism and white supremacy on this site. 

Among the many responses was this message from former CEO of Reddit, Ellen Pao. 

>[I am obligated to call you out: You should have shut down the_donald instead of amplifying it and its hate, racism, and violence. So much of what is happening now lies at your feet. You don't get to say BLM when reddit nurtures and monetizes white supremacy and hate all day long](https://twitter.com/ekp/status/1267689503797342208)

Many others shared links and screenshots of your past statements saying [“Open racism and slurs are fine to post on Reddit”](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2018/apr/12/racism-slurs-reddit-post-ceo-steve-huffman).

The problem of Reddit’s leadership supporting and providing a platform for racist users and hateful communities has long been an issue.  Nearly six years ago, [dozens of subreddits signed the original open letter to the Reddit admins](https://www.reddit.com/r/blackladies/comments/2ejg1b/we_have_a_racist_user_problem_and_reddit_wont/) calling for action.  While [the Reddit admins acknowledged the letter](https://www.reddit.com/r/blackladies/comments/2m9k6p/maybe_its_time_to_repost_the_open_letter_reddit/cm27j8j/) and said it was a high priority to address this issue, extremely little has been done in the intervening years.

On June 5, you shared this update on /r/Announcements, [Upcoming changes to our content policy, our board, and where we’re going from here](https://www.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/gxas21/upcoming_changes_to_our_content_policy_our_board/).  In the post, you stated that there is a need for continued adjustments of Reddit’s content policy to address racism and that this remains a priority.  These continued statements that you hear us, that this is a priority, or that you are working on it are not enough.  It has been five years since your return as CEO and this still remains Reddit’s most glaring problem.

Steve, if you and Reddit genuinely care about the values of standing up to racism and hate, then you need to back it up with real action.  As moderators on this website who have dedicated countless hours to keeping this site running, we call on Reddit to take the following steps:

* **Enact a sitewide policy against racism, slurs, and hatespeech targeted at protected groups.** For too many years, Steve Huffman and the other Admins have stood by and allowed this site to fester with hate in the name of “free speech.”  It is time to enact a specific and detailed policy that protects the disadvantaged members of our communities from hate based on their sexuality, gender identity, ethnicity, country of origin, religion, or disability.

* **Be proactive in banning hate-based communities**  In the past Reddit has only taken action on hate subreddits when they were featured in the news and risked Reddit’s reputation or when they were documented and featured on /r/AgainstHateSubreddits and other forums.  AHS should not have to be responsible for raising awareness of hate subreddits and reporting them to the admins.  This site should take responsibility for keeping its users safe by banning any remaining subreddits devoted to hate and racism and preventing the creation of hateful subreddits in the future. 

* **Be proactive in banning hate users** Reddit needs to not only ban hate subreddits, but must be proactive in banning the moderators of these subreddits and their most active users.  Too often these users have been allowed to stay on this website after numerous sitewide violations, letting them move on to participate in new hate communities and spread their vitriol further across this site.

* **Reddit needs to hire more minorities / women, especially in leadership roles** Reddit needs to hire more women and people of color — particularly in leadership roles in the company — to help shift the corporate culture and policies to be more equitable for all.  In addition, Reddit needs to take adequate steps to protect these employees from harassment. 

* **Reddit needs to hire more community managers** According to Reddit's [job listings](https://www.redditinc.com/careers) there are dozens of open positions that the company is hiring for, and yet not a single one for Community.  Reddit has enacted numerous policies over the years that have been detrimental to the ability of Reddit’s moderators or the broader Reddit community.  Reddit needs more community managers to build positive relations and engagement with the site’s volunteer moderators.

* **Honor Alexis Ohanian's wishes to have his Reddit Board seat filled with a black candidate** - On June 5, Reddit Co-Founder and Executive Chairman [announced that he would be stepping down](https://twitter.com/alexisohanian/status/1268943036228292608) from his role on Reddit's Board of Directors.  Alexis requested that his position be filled with a black candidate and we ask Reddit to honor that request.  While you have stated your intent to honor that request, we are asking for an announcement to be made on this decision in the next 3 months.  We believe this is not an issue that should be put off for action years down the road.

At /r/AgainstHateSubreddits, we have laid out the many failures of Steve time and again to stand up to white supremacy on this site [time]( https://www.reddit.com/r/AgainstHateSubreddits/comments/gv7mtn/steve_spez_huffman_is_finally_claiming_that_black/) and [time]( https://www.reddit.com/r/AgainstHateSubreddits/comments/a3q6ck/2018_reddit_review_a_year_of_hate_propaganda_and/) and [time]( https://www.reddit.com/r/AgainstHateSubreddits/comments/84q74p/bbc_calls_out_rthe_donald_for_being_a_thriving/) again.

With a website with the impact of Reddit on the broader conversations being held in communities around the world, this website needs real leadership and real action.

We hope that Reddit will not just share empty platitudes — but will take a meaningful stand against hate, and take these recommendations to heart.

"Why I changed from Pro-Palestine to Pro-Israel as an Irish person. Please help correct anything I may have gotten wrong, or missed out. ",396,IsraelPalestine,https://www.reddit.com/r/IsraelPalestine/comments/1hd9lnx/why_i_changed_from_propalestine_to_proisrael_as/,1734086658.0,"As an Irish Catholic, all of my family and friends are Pro-Palestine. Tbh I still wouldn't really say I am pro one side or the other, as it is a complex conflict and not like choosing sides in a football match. I feel sorry for innocent people on both sides. However, the more I learn, the more I sympathise with the Israeli perspective. I honestly think that the Pro-Palestine side is heavily reliant on 'buzzwords' which sound good on social media posts or when chanted on the streets, and twists a lot of the facts. For example, the way they frame the entire conflict is that of white settler-colonist Jews oppressing the poor indigenous brown people of Palestine. This resonates a lot with people in Ireland, who see it as equivalent to the long Irish struggle for national independence against the British. Indeed, people will point out that the British politician Balfour is a key figure behind both the partition of Palestine and the partition of Ireland/Northern Ireland. I now believe this to be a false equivalence. 

This is my current understanding. It may be imperfect and please help correct me....

For a start, the majority of Jews in Israel aren't white. I think it's sad that this racial element is so important, but apparently it is. The Middle-Eastern, or 'Mizrahi' Jews are the largest Jewish group in Israel. They considerably outnumber the 'Ashkenazi' Jews, or Jews of European descendent. More importantly, even the Jews of European descendent ultimately trace their heritage back to the Levant. At the end of the day, Jews come from Judea and Arabs come from Arabia. This is an over-simplification. But it is true that Jewish culture and ethnicity has been in the Levant for at least 3,000 years. The Jews were exiled from their homeland by the Romans 2,000 years ago. The Romans renamed the land 'Palestine'; it is not an Arabic word. Arab culture and religion came in the form of conquest after the invention of Islam in the 7th Century. Arab Muslim conquerers built the Al-Aqsa Mosque and the Dome of the Rock over the ruins of the temple on the Temple Mount, the holiest site in Judaism. By now Arab/Islamic culture has been in the region for well over 1,000 years, so they should also be considered native. 

Since the beginning of their exile 2,000 years ago, Jews have faced persecution wherever they went, either as 'Christ-killers', or as people who rejected the final Prophet, or later as racially impure. However, Jews never fully left their homeland, but remained a minority under centuries of Colonial rule by the Arab Caliphates and later the Ottoman Empire. Despite what most people in Ireland seem to think, the modern state of Israel was not created as a colony under British Imperialism. Jewish settlers began returning to their ancestral homeland to escape persecution in Europe from the late 1800's onwards, purchasing land from Arabs and from absentee landowners in Istanbul. They came as refugees, not conquerors. At that time Palestine was a backwater of the Ottoman Empire and its population was a faction of what it is today. Jewish settlers brought advanced agricultural and medical technology from Europe and helped transform the land and enable it to support a larger population. 

The Jewish persecution ultimately culminated in the Holocaust and the murder of 6 million Jews, at which point the world agreed that the Jews should have their own state. The UN decided to vote the state of Israel into existence - as part of a 2 state solution - in 1948 (a vote from which Britain actually abstained). Instead of accepting the democratic decision of the majority of the world's nations, Israel's bigger more powerful neighbours (Egypt, Jordan, Syria, Iraq) decided to invade and try to wipe out the early state. Somehow Israel managed to win this war, but hundreds of thousands of Palestines were displaced as a result. My understanding is that many were told by the Arab armies to flee during the war and promised they would be able to return home after the inevitable destruction of Israel. On the Jewish side, hundreds of thousands of Jews in North Africa and the Middle East - who had been there since the time of the Roman exile - were forced by the governments of those countries to leave. For example, before 1948 Morocco had around 250,000 Jews and today it has less than 2,000. Iraq had 150,000 Jews, but today less than 5. Talk about 'ethnic cleansing'. The majority of the Jews of Israel today are the descendants of these refugees ('Mizrahi' Jews). I believe so much death and suffering could have been avoided if the Arab nations had accepted this 1948 partition plan. 

Since 1948 Israel's Arab Muslim majority neighbouring countries invaded it 4 more times (6 days war, Yom Kippur War, etc.) and each time Israel has won. I believe a big factor in this is the effectiveness of military organisation in democratic states in contrast to authoritarian states. Since then, dictators in authoritarian regimes in the Middle East have had an incentive to keep the conflict alive in order to present themselves as champions of the Palestinian cause and distract from internal human rights issues in their own regimes. Therefore neighbouring countries have continued to deny subsequent generations of Palestinian refugees citizenship and equal rights. However, by 2023 Israel was in the process of normalising relationships with the Arab Muslim states in peace negotiations facilitated by Saudi Arabia. The greatest antagonist in the Middle East today (Iran) could not tolerate this, so planned for its proxies Hamas and Hezbollah to launch attacks on Israel beginning with the atrocities of Oct 7th. 

This is where I believe the ability of an Irish person to understand the conflict breaks down completely. If we consider the 2 major groups of the Palestinian resistance movement to be the 'PLO' (Palestinian Liberation Organisation) and Hamas, I believe the average Irish person can see reflections of the 'IRA' (Irish Republican Army) in the PLO. They are non-state actors willing to use violent means to achieve regional nationalistic goals. A free and united Irish state, a free Palestinian state. Tbh I think the PLO are much more fanatical than the IRA and harder to negotiate with. In the 1970's - Black September - the PLO tried to assassinate the King of Jordan and started a civil war. They got kicked out of Jordan and moved to Lebanon where they started a civil war that transformed the country from one of the most stable countries in the Middle East to the Lebanon of today in which a third of the country is ruled by a terrorist organisation. 4 times the PLO were offered a 2 state solution, and everything they were asking for, and each time they rejected it. In the 1990s the PLO supported Saddam Hussein's genocidal persecution of the Kurds. In contrast, in the 1990s the IRA disarmed and accepted a peace agreement that would see Northern Ireland remain part of the UK until such time as - through democratic referendum - the majority of the population chose to leave the UK and reunite with the Republic of Ireland. 

Unfortunately, I believe the PLO are still more reasonable actors than Hamas, who are not interested in regional nationalistic goals such as the creation of a Palestinian state, but follow a globalist ideology of Jihad. If I understand correctly, Hamas don't even believe in the concept of the nation-state and believe that humans shouldn't be divided into different nationalities; there should just be Muslims and non-Muslims. They seek to re-establish the Islamic Caliphate. The fanatical Shia Mullahs of Tehran - who train and fund Hamas, Hezbollah and the Houthis - believe that global conflict is a prerequisite for the return of the Mahdi and the end of the world. This includes key events in modern day Syria, Yemen and the return of the Jews to the Holyland (specifically Jerusalem). From an Irish perspective - concerned with regional nationalistic struggle - it is almost impossible to empathise with this point of view, or how organisations could seriously base their geopolitical strategy on such eschatological nonsense. For this reason, Irish people are completely blind to this aspect of the conflict. But this is exactly what Hamas and Hezbollah believe and why they can't be negotiated with. They live in a different reality in which life in the secular world is unimportant compared to the eternal hereafter. Hamas leaders have even declared that they love death as much as the Jews and Americans love life. 

  
The IRA, as bad as they might have been, were motivated by nationalism, not religious fanaticism and would never have engaged in the kind of violence against women and children that was undertaken by Hamas on Oct. 7th. Many Irish people unfortunately see that day as an uprising similar to the Easter Rising of Irish rebels against the British government in Ireland in 1916. They can't see the conflict as anything but a nationalistic struggle against colonial oppression. Because how could anyone seriously believe in that kind of religious end-of-the-world religious nonsense? And this is what leads Irish people to view the conflict through the lens of the other key buzzwords; 'genocide' and 'apartheid' state. After all, the actions of the British government continuing to export food from Ireland during the potato famine were arguably genocidal, and Catholics remained second class citizens in the apartheid state in Ireland created by the Protestant Ascendancy of the 17th Century. Never mind that almost 20% of Israel citizens are Arab Muslim, some of which are lawyers, doctors, members of the Supreme Court. I believe that Arab Muslims in Israel have more rights and a higher quality of life than Arab Muslims in almost any other country in the Middle East. The benefits of living in a liberal democracy as opposed to living under a dictatorship or theocracy. And from what I understand the road signs are in Hebrew, Arabic and English, which would be a very unusual step for an apartheid state to take. 

It might not be surprising therefore that there are thousands of Arab Muslim Israelis in the IDF, as well as other religious and ethnic minorities such as Christians and Druze, who know how much better their lives are under a democratic government than they would be under an authoritarian or Islamic government like Hamas. I don't know how they expect us to believe that an army is committing genocide against a specific ethnic group, when that army itself has thousands of soldiers from that same ethnic group. There were zero Bosniak Muslim soldiers in the Serbian army in the actual genocide in Bosnia in the 1990s. The numbers also don't add up. 2 million people in Gaza, 44,000 dead, half of which are Hamas terrorists. The death of a single innocent civilian is heartbreaking, but it is a tragically unavoidable part of war. I believe many on the Pro-Palestine side are naive regarding the difference between war and genocide. The absolute number seems low for a genocide (compared to other ongoing conflicts in the region; 600,000 dead in Syria, 400,000 dead in Yemen). Also the combatant:civilian death ratio 1:1 or maybe 1:1.5, whereas a typical modern urban war involves more like 4, 5 or 6 civilian deaths for every 1 combatant. 

The fact that so many people are fixated on the number of dead is also unusual I think, and not typical of any previous conflicts. I truly believe that if social media and smartphones had existed during WW2, many supporters of the Pro-Palestinian movement would have been posting videos on TikTok of German children being pulled from the rubble and saying 'We have to have a ceasefire now, too many German civilians have been killed. The Allies are clearly evil. Let's give the Nazis time to regain their strength and build up their technology, but we just have to have a ceasefire now.' 

One side is completely based on buzzwords, street protests and social media 'influencers'. The depressing part is that no one has the time to look into the history or geopolitical and religious nuances of the conflict, it's so much easier to watch a short TikTok video with emotional background music, or shout buzzwords in a street protest. The likelihood I will be able to convince any of my friends or family to re-evaluate the nuances of the conflict are so close to zero as to basically not be worth attempting. 

","['Thank you. I am not Irish but someone who has always been interested in reading and educating myself about the Troubles and the IRA. I’m a Muslim actually who also steps back a bit and says hmm there is a lot of history here to unfold and how are the Arab nations not held accountable for their trajectory of this path the last few decades the Palestinians and their leaders have been on. I also shake my head at Ireland and its politicians being vocal about being pro Palestinian and equating it to the troubles of NI and Ireland. Like the two issues were not the same by any means. Actually just shows how stupid people are, how influenced the world is by that stupidity. Just some easy researching would show both issues are NOT the same. \nAnd with everything coming to light in Syria, I’ve asked myself where were all you “humanitarians” and protesters. Full of 💩. Shown me something to be true I read once: antisemitism never left this earth, it seeps underground and every century rears its ugly head, it’s something Jews have had to deal with from the dawn of the Abrahamic times. Don’t know why, maybe it’s because they were the first and as the other religions followed, the Jews who did not convert or want to were looked upon as trouble or defiant. I don’t know why. But both religions that followed tried their best to rid the world of Jews. Yet fast forward to 2024 and we are supposed to inclusive and free blah blah. Right except if you’re a Jew. I have the utmost respect for their struggle. That doesn’t dismiss any wrong doings by politicians or policies that have hindered peace on both sides. But ..bigger picture ..zoom out more ..even more ..you’ll understand the struggle and be just a bit more aware.', 'So very well written.   Thank you', ""As an arab, myself, after Oct 7, I was shocked at the way people were celebrating and encouraging violence. It took me a lot of learning and unlearning and eventually came to the same conclusion as you.   \n  \nI've found it really difficult to be vocal about my recent shift in mindset because the western pro-palestinian side is so toxic and scary but that's where the change needs to come from.\n\nanyway, thank you for sharing""]",0.04982515219639684,0.4043872198378635,1
Victoria 3: Everything We Know So Far,6970,victoria3,https://www.reddit.com/r/victoria3/comments/nhzt1w/victoria_3_everything_we_know_so_far/,1621622829.0,"For a broad overview of Vicky 3, check out my announcement coverage on IGN: https://www.ign.com/articles/paradox-reveals-victoria-3-a-long-awaited-sequel-to-a-grand-strategy-series

For everything else...

**CAVEAT: Everything I saw was very work-in-progress. Anything could change, especially specific numbers.**

**KEY:** This is a simulation. It's not a map painter. Military conquest is not the main focus. Victoria 3 is more about diplomatic maneuvering, shaping your society and laws, building and industrializing your economy, and ""tending the garden"" of your nation.

* 1836 - 1936.

* 4 ticks per day, so the number of ticks per campaign is similar to EU4.

* The map is divided into States and Provinces. There are about 730 States at game start, which are the smallest unit you will interact with for purposes of politics and economics.

* It's possible to split existing states, such as when you demand a Treaty Port in a war or Diplomatic Play. This creates a new State that is only one Province in size. Even at game start there are some cases of having more than one State, gameplay-wise, within a single ""State Area.""

* Provinces are subdivisions that you usually only interact with for maneuvering armies and when colonizing (which is done one Province at a time as you add more Provinces to your Colonial State), and there are roughly the same number of individual Provinces as in HoI4. (According to Google, that's around 13,000 - roughly 18 Provinces per State on average.)

* Visually, urbanization will spread across individual Provinces within a State.

* The pre-alpha map we saw looks better than HoI4 but worse than CK3/Imperator. They did say specifically that it isn't done yet. You can definitely zoom in further than HoI4, so I'd say the map overall feels bigger than the HoI4 map. Zoomed all the way out it looks very similar to the Vicky 2 paper map. Zoomed in you can see realistic clouds and stuff drifting over the landscape. Railroads are visible.

* Well over 100 playable countries, but not all countries are playable. Most of Africa, parts of inner South America, and a few surviving native tribes in North America (including the Lakota, Dakota, and Cree) were not playable. These are ""Decentralized Countries."" Post-launch, they want to make them playable eventually. But they want to do them right because the gameplay experience should be significantly different. All the Decentralized Countries have names and governments. There are no ""uncolonized"" provinces, but you can colonize on top of a Decentralized Country without declaring war.

* Full POPs like Victoria 2. Over a billion people are modeled individually, which will roughly double by game end, including Dependents. These represent non-working children and homemakers. Your laws, i.e. Child Labor laws, determine how much economic output your Dependents create and if they collect wages. So like, kids will still be counted as Dependents, but your wages from Dependents might go up (along with mortality rate.)

* Example POP types I saw (not exhaustive): Capitalists, Laborers, Machinists, Farmers, Shopkeepers, Engineers, Aristocrats, Clergymen, Officers, Bureaucrats, Academics, Servicemen, Clerks

* Standard of Living is mostly based on a POP's Wealth, which is determined by your sources of revenue minus your expenses. This can be a salary from your job, stipends and wages from dependents in countries where women and children can work (or if they're receiving welfare payments), and dividends from buildings you own. Increasing wages, lowering taxes, and increasing the supply of goods (thus lowering the prices and therefore the lifestyle expenses) will all generally raise Standard of Living. Standard of Living affects POP Loyalty and Population Growth.

* Your GDP measures how much you produce and affects your Great Power ranking, but it doesn't necessarily reflect how much money you, as a player, have to spend. The Ottomans, for example, start with a very inefficient tax system, so they have a small state budget compared to their GDP.

* Capitalists work completely differently from Vicky 2. Capitalism isn't ""Let The AI Do It Mode."" Instead, Capitalists (and sometimes Aristocrats depending on your laws) invest profits from buildings they own into a new resource pool separate from state funds called the Investment Pool, which you can only spend on certain things based on your laws and economic system. So you are still personally directing the expansion of industry in a capitalist economy, with some restrictions.

* Every nation has a primary culture and state religion, with varying levels of acceptance for other religions and cultures based on your laws. Non-accepted POPs are paid lower wages (so have a lower Standard of Living) and are more likely to radicalize.

* In places like the US, discrimination is on a racial basis. This is based on your country's laws and can be changed. There are no culture groups, but cultures have traits like Heritage traits and Linguistic traits, and your laws will look at how alike or different those are to your main culture. So someone from England will be less discriminated against in American society. Someone from a different part of Europe will face some more discrimination than the Englishman but not too much. Someone from Africa or Asia will face a lot of discrimination.

* Every State has a proportion of Arable Land, which represents how much agricultural industry it can support. Arable Land you have not directly built any buildings on will automatically generate Subsistence Farms, which employ Peasants. Peasants represent the vast majority of the world's population at game start, and they don't produce very many taxes or sellable goods since they're just focused on their own survival. So you'll generally want to start moving them to work in other industries if you want to grow your GDP and your tax base.

* Spheres have been replaced with Markets. There are many local markets instead of a single world market. Expanding your market is going to be a new playstyle aside from conquest - ""painting the map economically"". You can bring other countries into your market diplomatically or through war. Trade between markets is done by setting up one-way Import and Export trade deals for specific goods, of which you can only have a limited number at a time per market, based on a number of factors.

* An example given was that Mecklenburg starts out in the Prussian market (modelling the historical Zollverein Customs Union), which may allow them to build luxury furniture to meet the demands of the wealthy Prussian elite. But if they leave that market to form their own, their own elites may not have enough money to afford those luxury goods, and their economy will suffer unless they can set up trade deals to find buyers abroad or join a different, larger market.

* The number of countries that can be in your market at a time is based on the market leader's diplomatic **Influence, which is one of the main capacity types.** Capacities are different from power/mana in that it's not a pool of points you build up and spend. It's more like having enough electricity to run a lot of devices. Influence is also used for things like alliances, etc. You get Influence primarily from having rivalries, your Power Ranking (Great Powers get a ton), and a few other things that add percentage modifiers.

* Prices of goods are based on Supply and Demand. It's not event-based with arbitrary starting prices like EU4. Full market simulation. POPs and Industries will place Buy orders while Industries will also place Sell orders for finished goods. There's a screen that lets you see what are currently the five most under-produced and the five most overproduced goods in your market, so you can set up trade deals or expand industries to meet demand better.

* The other factor that affects this is Infrastructure. Having insufficient infrastructure will make it harder to get goods from a given State to your wider market efficiently.

* Around 50 trade goods divided into Staples - Consumed by all POPs for daily needs, Industrial Goods - Consumed by industries to make other finished goods, Luxury Goods - consumed by POPs with higher Standard of Living, and Military Goods - Used to create military units including infantry, artillery, ships, and later tanks and planes.

* Trade Goods (incomplete list, mostly guessing based on icons): Tools, Glass, Wood, Coal, Luxury Furniture, Porcelain, Silk, Iron, Chemicals, Meat, Cannons, Ammunition, Fish, Sulfur, Basic Furniture, Clipper Ships, Ironclads, Luxury Clothing, Paper, Artillery Shells, Fruit, Tea, Tobacco, Baked Goods, Coffee, Wine, Steel, Standard Clothing, Guns, Grain, Automobiles, Alcohol, Cotton

* Production buildings have resource inputs and outputs, Throughput rating, and pay wages to all employed POPs. If their output can sell for more than their inputs, they will generate dividends that are paid to the owners and increase their Wealth. Otherwise, they will need to be subsidized or else they will fail. Each also has a personal cash reserve, presumably so it can run at a loss for a bit without subsidies.

* Production Methods affect how buildings operate. For instance, a workshop can be Privately Owned, belong to a Merchant Guild, Publicly Traded, Government Run, or a Worker Cooperative. This affects what kind of POPs are employed here, what wages they are paid, and who collects the dividends/profits. i.e. Privately Owned workshops will employ Capitalists who get most of the wealth generated with the workers getting only wages, whereas in a Worker Cooperative, the people doing the work own the workshop and split the Wealth it generates evenly.

* Government Run industries have mandatory subsidies, meaning any losses they incur will come directly out of your national treasury rather than letting them go out of business. But you can also pocket any profits.

* You can have a Statist, command economy without being Communist. Communism itself, while it often goes hand-in-hand with a command economy, is now more directly related to distribution of wealth and political power. Communism is not when the government does things. The government doing more things doesn't make it more communister.

* POPs can promote/demote and some types are more likely than others. Engineers and Shopkeepers are more likely to become Capitalists, for instance.

* Command Economies do not allow Capitalists or Aristocrats to be employed in your nation, so they will have to find a new job or leave. They also get fewer foreign Trade Routes to work with, but can enact Encourage Consumption, Discourage Consumption, and Consumption Taxes more cheaply. They can embargo all goods and they can (must) subsidize everything.

* You need to have a Command Economy to switch Production Method to Government Control.

* Free Trade gives you more import/export routes, reduces loan interest rates, allows you to subsidize only Service Industries and Infrastructure, and increases the amount of wealth Capitalists contribute to the Investment Pool.

* Isolation cuts off all foreign trade (so you can only operate within your Market/Customs Union), you can embargo all goods, you can subsidize all buildings, and both Capitalists and Aristocrats will contribute to the Investment Pool.

* Traditionalism (used mostly by Unrecognized countries and represents pre-industrial economies): Fewer trade routes, can subsidize only Services and Infrastructure.

* Agrarianism gives you more export routes, lets you subsidize agriculture, infrastructure, and services, Aristocrats contribute to the Investment Pool, and you can embargo Luxury Goods

* Different economic systems dictate what you can or cannot spend Investment Pool money on.

* Services are a non-tradeable good, so they cannot leave your home market. Access to services is based on Infrastructure. So for example, you might have lots of services being produced in New York, but if you don't build railroads out to California, the people in California will have very little or no access to those services (and goods from California won't be able to get to market efficiently) even though both states are in the US market. Until you have better infrastructure, you'll have to rely on producing most things locally.

* Services come from buildings called Urban Centers, which can't be directly built but are generated automatically based on the Urbanization of your States. All buildings you build produce a little bit of Urbanization in the target State, but some provide a lot more than others. If you focus more on expanding agriculture, you won't have as many Urban Centers. If you build lots of Factories and government buildings, you will generate much more Urbanization. The Service sector will employ POPs as well.

* Classes: Lower, Middle, and Upper strata. Determined by POP type. It mainly determines their wage level and taxation under uneven tax laws. Standard of Living goes all the way up to 100, which would be ""Jeff Bezos level"", but you generally won't see anything above 50 unless you're trying to break the game.

* If you have a system like worker-owned factories, you can get to a point where even the lower strata POPs in your country are richer by the late game than the capitalists were at the beginning. 

* Each POP is represented by a 3D character model, looks like the same basic models from CK3, including regional and class-appropriate dress.

* National leaders have 3D, CK3-style portraits and character traits (up to 3 in the build we saw). Monarchies have heirs who also get a portrait.

* POPs can belong to Interest Groups, and these are the main forces that you must contend with to make changes to your society. Not all POPs of a specific type belong to the same Interest Group. i.e. Capitalists are likely to join the Industrialists interest group, but some of them might instead belong to the Devout.

* There are a handful of ""Templates"" for interest groups that will be used in just about every country, but they can have different traits and desires. For example, Industrialists in Prussia are very pro-Monarchy, whereas in the U.S. that is very much not the case.

* Example Interest Groups we got to see: Industrialists, Landowners (called Junkers in Prussia, Landed Gentry in Britain, Plantation Owners in the US, and Scholar-Officials in Qing), Intelligentsia (called Literati in Qing), Devout (called Anglican Church in Britain and Confucian Schools in Qing) - they said this one specifically will change A LOT in ideology depending on the dominant religion of your country, Armed Forces, Rural Folk, Petite Bourgeoisie, Trade Unions

* Interest Groups have a set of Ideologies, as well as Traits that can be active or inactive at any given time.

* Interest Groups also have a leader with a portrait and traits.

* Ideologies can change over time (such as Trade Unions becoming more socialist). They will be stable for most of the game, but certain events, ideas, and leaders can cause them to shift. The leader of the Interest Group might be a socialist, for instance. They are still tweaking how ideologically malleable or fixed these groups should be.

* Prussian Industrialists have Monarchist (very upset if you switch to any non-Monarchy form of government), Individualist (Disapprove of most welfare/social security/government healthcare/public schools), Abolitionist (Don't like slavery), two others that we didn't get to see.

* If Ideologies are what an IG wants, Traits are what they can do for you. These traits will become active if the IG is loyal enough to your government. Kind of like how loyal Institutions provide bonuses in EU4. The one we got to see for the Industrialists was Job Creators, which increases the contribution to the Investment Pool by Capitalist POPs by 10% if their loyalty is at least 20.

* You can invite Interest Groups into your government. The ones that aren't part of your government will be in Opposition. You can never make everyone happy so you have to choose which groups to champion.

* Clout is how much influence an Interest Group has in your nation. In 1836, the main factors are Wealth, Status, and Workforce. If you liberalize your country you can offset this with Votes. When you hold elections, each Interest Group receives Votes from the enfranchised POPs that support it, which increases their Clout by a set amount per Vote until the next election. Various laws can tweak the political weight of Votes vs Wealth, or give more people Votes, though Wealth will always be a factor. So a truly egalitarian society will need to level the playing field in terms of wealth inequality in addition to democratic reforms.

* Not all POPs belong to an Interest Group at game start. Some of them are considered Politically Inactive.

* Literacy is back from Vicky 2, with your education spending determining what percentage of the country has access to education rather than just how fast it ticks up toward 100%. 100% Literacy will be very hard to achieve. Literate POPs can take certain jobs that illiterate ones cannot. It will be hard to get modern factories and government institutions up and running with low Literacy.

* Higher Literacy also affects your likelihood to join an Interest Group rather than being Politically Inactive, which sort of replaces the Consciousness system from Vicky 2. Uneducated laborers are more likely to stay out of politics. Likewise, ideas like Egalitarianism and Socialism will spread to your country faster if the lower classes are educated, which further increase political participation, expected minimum Standards of Living, and cause more attraction to groups like the Trade Unions among laborers. If the expected minimum Standard of Living goes up but the actual Standard of Living for those POPs does not, they will start to radicalize. So you can give them more beer and amenities to suppress class consciousness, is basically what it sounds like.

* You can Suppress or Promote IGs directly using your **Authority, which is an administrative capacity stat.** More absolutist forms of government have more Authority, and so will have more control over the IGs in their nation, whereas democracies will be less able to combat or uplift the ones they prefer.

* Legitimacy is basically a check against inviting too many Interest Groups into your government. If you try to form too large of a coalition, your Legitimacy will tank. You also get Legitimacy from having the Interest Group your leader belongs to in the government – so as Prussia, we had to have the Armed Forces in the government, because they're the king's faction, or we would take a hit to Legitimacy. And that in turn makes it harder to ever pass any laws the military doesn't like. In a Presidential Republic like the US, you might have a different interest group represented by the head of state every election cycle, which dictates what you can accomplish during that term.

* An Autocracy requires you to work with fewer Interest Groups to maintain Legitimacy, whereas a Parliamentary Republic can form larger coalitions. By the same token, Autocratic governments can commit to a more defined strategy (at the risk of annoying everyone who is not part of the government), whereas Republics will have to make more compromises and only be able to pass policies with very broad, cross-party support (while making more people feel their voices are being heard).

* Trickle Migration (Vicky 2 style) will mostly happen within cultural regions, to/from colonies, and within your market. i.e. Germanic cultured pops will be free to move around the Germanic home region, between your metropole and your colonies, or anywhere in their home country's market. POPs won't just trickle migrate wherever at all times.

* The exception to this is Migration Waves, which can be caused by poor economic conditions, political unrest, ethnic discrimination, etc. These will be major events, rather than a trickle. i.e. famine in Ireland might trigger a Migration Wave from Ireland to the US. They will try to target countries that have better standards of living and freer laws than the place they're leaving, but it's not explicitly tied to New World vs Old World like in Vicky 2. So the US and Brazil won't have any arbitrary advantage in attracting immigrants, though conditions in those nations might still make them popular destinations.

* Falling Standard of Living can generate Radical pops (replacing Vicky 2's Militancy system), while rising Standard of Living can convert Radicals to neutrals, or neutrals to Loyalists. Having more Radicals in a state generates Turmoil, which can affect the economy and lead to uprisings. Having more Radicals in an Interest Group will lower that group's Approval score toward the current government (and Loyalists in an interest group will do the opposite), which can lead to a civil war or revolution. Cultural discrimination can also generate Radicals.

* Higher wealth POPs have a lower threshold to radicalize because they expect a higher standard of living. ""They can only afford 100 Ming vases instead of 150, and this is absolutely unacceptable.""

* Loyalist POPs (and Radicals) can die off, which causes intergenerational conflict. If you had an era of prosperity that generated a lot of Loyalists, and then they die, the younger generation with worse economic opportunities might suddenly be not so happy and change the loyalty and attitude of your Interest Groups. 

* You can fund Police Institutions to reduce the local effects of Radicals. They don't go away, but they won't be able to cause as much trouble. You can also bring up the standard of living or change discriminating laws to deradicalize them. Or you can discriminate even harder and hope they decide to go live somewhere else.

* Enslaved POPs will be modeled. This is a historical simulation. They don't want to stray away from the parts of history that are horrific and pretend they didn't exist. They also don't want to pretend that it was a good idea. As an example, slavery is not a flat boon for your country, but it is very profitable for plantation owners, and those Interest Groups will fight against abolition because it's in their economic interest – they want to keep those unpaid wages for themselves and spend them on luxuries. You as the player will have to decide how to deal with those groups.

* At the same time, not every nation needs to be on a set trajectory toward liberalism. If you want to keep Russia an absolutist feudal serf state until the endgame, you can do that assuming you can deal with any radicals who want to change it. There is no assumed best path.

* Example needs for higher wealth pops: Free Movement (Transportation or Automobiles), Luxury Items, Luxury Drinks, Intoxicants, Communication, Heating - Needs are different from goods, and many of them can be filled by multiple different types of goods.

* Example Laws (Not a complete list, just the ones I saw) -

**POWER STRUCTURE**

* Governance Principles: Monarchy, Chiefdom, Presidential Republic, Parliamentary Republic, Council Republic

* Distribution of Power: Autocracy, Oligarchy, Elder Council, Landed Voting, Wealth Voting, Census Suffrage, Universal Suffrage, Anarchy

* Citizenship: National Supremacy

* Church and State: Freedom of Conscience

* Bureaucracy: Appointed Bureaucrats

* Conscription: Conscription

* Internal Security: No Home Affairs

**ECONOMY**

* Economic System: Mercantilism, Free Trade, Traditionalism, Isolationism, Agrarianism, Command Economy

* Income Tax: No Income Tax, Payroll Tax (more burden on the poor), Proportional Tax (everyone pays a flat percentage), Graduated Tax (more burden on the wealthy)

* Poll Tax: No Poll Tax

* Colonization: No Colonial Affairs

* Policing: Local Police Force

* Education: Public Schools, Religious Schools, No Schools, Private Schools

* Health System: No Health System, Charity Hospitals, Private Health Insurance, Public Health Insurance

**HUMAN RIGHTS**

* Free Speech: Censorship

* Labor Rights: Serfdom Abolished

* Children's Rights: Child Labor Allowed

* Rights of Women: Propertied Women, Legal Guardianship

* Welfare: Poor Laws, Wage Controls, No Social Security, Pensions

* Migration: No Migration Controls

* Slavery: Slavery Banned

* Passing laws an interest group doesn't like will lower their approval. If they get upset enough, they can start a civil war. You can only pass laws if at least one interest group that is part of your government approves of it, and many of them require specific inventions as a prerequisite (ie: Graduated Income Tax requires Socialism.) The more Interest Groups that are part of your government approve of a law, the faster you can implement it.

* Institutions are like the organs of your government. Some Institutions are unlocked by specific laws. They have five levels each, with increasing bonuses but also increasing Bureaucracy cost. **Bureaucracy is the third capacity, along with Authority and Influence, that is generated by building government buildings in your states and having Bureaucrat and Clerk pops working in them** (which also requires literacy). Going over your Bureaucratic capacity will give you a tax penalty due to governmental inefficiency, but there's also a hard cap on the number of Institution levels you can have, which can be raised over time.

* Example Institutions- These modifiers can change based on your laws

* Conscription Office: +2% Conscription Rate and increases the number of Battalions you can mobilize per level (with Conscription)

* Education: +15% Education access per level (with Public education), +2% Wealth-based Education Access (this scales with Wealth so it works out to much higher than 2% at very high Wealth levels) and +20% Intelligentsia Political Strength (with Private Schools), +10% education Access, +20% religious Conversion rate, +20% Devout Political Strength per level (with Religious Schools)

* Law Enforcement: +10 Landowners Political Strength and -20% State Penalties from Turmoil per level (with Local Policing), -5% Radicals from Standard of Living decreases and -15% State penalties from Turmoil with ???

* Colonial Affairs: +20% Colony Growth per level

* Social Security: +10% Industrialists political strength and +2 Minimum Wealth per level

* Workplace Safety Offices: -2% Mortality of Laborers, Machinists, and Engineers employed in Mines and -20% to Dangerous Working Conditions per level

* National Security Agency - No modifiers shown
 
* Institutions only apply their benefits to Incorporated parts of your country. You can also have Unincorporated areas. The Bureaucratic cost per investment level is based on the total population in all of your Incorporated states, so the more people benefitting from services will result in needing more bureaucrats to maintain.

* Institutions also have a financial cost since you're paying the wages of the Bureaucrat POPs out of the state treasury. There will always be some bureaucrats, even if you're not funding a bunch of government institutions, just from enacting your laws in Incorporated states.

* States like the Qing will begin with massive, sprawling bureaucracies that have a significant impact on their playstyle. They have a huge population in their Incorporated States day one, which is a colossal bureaucratic sink before you even start adding Institutions on top. You probably can't bring 100% education access to everyone in China because it would take an absurd amount of bureaucratic investment, while smaller nations will have a much easier time doing this.

* It's a valid playstyle to run a ""lean state"" with very few bureaucrats and very few or no public services, freeing people up to do other jobs and relying on the Investment Pool instead of state revenue to expand infrastructure and industry. Minting can allow some countries to replace taxation.

* Diplomatic actions are your standard Paradox stuff. New ones include Trade Agreements, Invite to Customs Union (making them part of your Market), Violate Sovereignty, Start Bankrolling - I didn't get to ask what those last two do but Bankroll is probably just monthly subsidies.

* Diplomatic Plays: Basically an evolution of the crisis system from Vicky 2. **This is now the default way you try to get things from other countries who do not want to give them to you!** I described it as almost like ""Diplomatic Combat.""

* Types of plays:

* Conquer State, Liberate Subject, Make Puppet, Open Market, Take Treaty Port, Transfer Subject, Annex Subject, Cut Down to Size, Declare Independence, Ban Slavery, Make Territory, Make Vassal, Return State, Take Colony, Unify Region (in the example we saw it was called ""Unify Germany"").

* You put your starting demands on the table. Enemy puts their starting demands on the table. It then enters a maneuvering phase where either side can add wargoals, other countries can become involved (mostly if they actually want something from either side - rivals will be very likely to join just to stop you from getting what you want.)

* Ultimately you can back down (the side that didn't blink gets their original wargoal, but not any extra wargoals that were added later by themselves or other nations that became involved), or let the timer expire and go to war (everyone who placed a demand on the table gets called in and all demands on both sides are up for grabs).

* It's possible to Sway nations during the maneuver phase, offering them spoils of war to join your side. This isn't just useful for securing their alliance if it does go to war. Tipping the balance of power more and more in your favor also makes it more likely that the other side will Back Down.

* The more demands you add to your side of the table, the more **POTENTIAL threat** you will generate and the more likely it is that other nations will pledge their support to your enemy. Particularly if you are a Great Power, other Great Powers will try to head off any massive wars of conquest before they even start by pledging their support to the target and trying to get you to Back Down, to maintain the balance of power. So it's generally safer to eat your neighbors one bite at a time unless you think you can take on everyone at once.

* Allies will generally side with you or stay out of your way. Countries with friendly relations or who don't see you as a threat are also generally unlikely to get involved, so maintaining a strong diplomatic position with other Great Powers will enable faster conquests with less meddling.

* At any point during this process, before war is declared, you can Mobilize your armies to have a head start, which might cause your opponent to back down. If you wait until the war has already started to mobilize, you will be on the back foot compared to countries that mobilized before the timer ran out.

* They don't want this system to make every single conquest into a World War and it's being balanced accordingly. It's always a possibility though if you as a player try to overreach too much.

* They don't want to say One Tag World Conquest is impossible because the players will always find a way, but they described it as ""implausible.""

* There is no Status Quo in a Diplomatic Play. Either you go to war, or one side Backs Down and the other gets their initial wargoal. (But ONLY the initial wargoal.) So you can't use it risk-free to test the waters.

* No more ""uncivilized"" nations. Instead there are ""Unrecognized"" nations, which basically means they weren't seen as equals by the Great Powers at the time. They do NOT get any arbitrary debuffs to technology or combat just for having the ""unrecognized"" flag. They play by the same rules as everyone else for the most part.

* They will start out technologically behind in many cases, based on historical circumstances, and the social and economic conditions they have to deal with will generally make it harder to become an advanced, industrialized, technologically competitive nation. But that's all tied to the laws, POPs, Interest Groups, resources, and starting infrastructure, not their Unrecognized status.

* The one direct, mechanical difference is that it's cheaper and generates less threat for Recognized nations to take land from Unrecognized nations.

* You can go from Unrecognized to Recognized, for example by beating up a Great Power. The Russo-Japanese War was given as an example of an Unrecognized nation becoming Recognized.

* Colonization works in two different ways: Colonization against Decentralized Countries can be done like in EU4, where you can theoretically do it without open conflict. You establish a Colonial Institution back home and employ POPs as Colonists who will slowly build up the colony in the target province. During this time, you will generate a Tension score with the Decentralized Country you are colonizing on top of, which can result in open warfare. The natives will annex your colony if they win.

* Machine Guns no longer magically make you able to colonize new areas like in Vicky 2. They just help against uprisings if you do have to fight. Medical advances like Malaria Medication will have a major impact on where you can colonize, though.

* Colonization against Unrecognized nations, it's more like declaring a regular war. You can make them your colonial subject, or you can demand a Treaty Port, which will create a new State under your control and give you access to their market.

* Outright annexing overseas territory by either method will create a Colonial State, which is not the same as an Unincorporated State. They are affected by colonial policies, have special migration rules, and distinct mechanics.

* War/combat is unfinished. They're not ready to talk about it yet.

* Prestige is still a thing and affects your Great Power ranking. Cut Down to Size wargoal will take a bite out of your prestige.

* GDP affects your Great Power ranking directly, even if you as the state are not benefitting from that production through taxation. What matters is production, not government revenue. Factories, especially late game, will cause GDP to skyrocket, so you will need to industrialize to remain competitive as a Great Power.

* Each Power Rank has its own intended play experience.

* Minor Powers: Ideal for playing tall. Local concerns. Min-maxing your economy, encouraging immigration, building exactly the society you want, ""tending your garden,"" becoming regionally powerful/influential.

* Major Power: Might have some colonies. Mass political movements outside your control might try to change the shape of your country (this is less of a concern for minor powers). Becoming a Great Power is a realistic goal.

* Great Powers: Global influence. Maintaining and disrupting the worldwide balance of power. Getting involved in smaller nations' affairs in lots of ways beyond just conquest. Proxy conflicts. Gunboat diplomacy. Being #1. They get more tools to change industry top-down, from a macro level, with a single click. You shouldn't be really concerned with economic micromanagement, but still have a lot of control over your economy in broader ways.

* Three different Tech Trees: Production, Military, and Society. More like a traditional, branching 4X tech tree, not like the tech columns in Vicky 2. No split between techs and inventions. Seems like no more RNG for inventions other than that Tech Spread has some RNG involved.

* About 10 ""tiers"" of tech. Earlier ones might only have three techs in them but later ones have up to 11.

* Production Tech represents the major civilian inventions of the era that directly affect industry. Dynamite, Railways, Cotton Gin, Telegraph.

* Military Tech is pretty self-explanatory. Hardware as well as doctrines. Ironclads, Machine Guns, Modern Nursing, Defense in Depth. Tanks and Planes are at the very bottom. Having something researched doesn't automatically implement it, so for example, just researching Defense in Depth won't give you its benefits until you decide to enact it.

* Society Tech is stuff like Romanticism, Urban Planning, Central Banking, Dialectics. Anarchism and Socialism are two separate ideologies now that function differently. Antibiotics, Malaria Prevention, and other civilian stuff unrelated to direct production of goods is also in this tree.

* Innovations (including social movements like Socialism) can spread into your country even if you choose not to research them, which can be combated by things like censorship at the cost of slowing down your Innovation rate and upsetting the Intelligentsia.

* Almost every tech has advantages and disadvantages. i.e. automation increases overall throughput and reduces costs, but also reduces the number of available jobs in that industry, so you have to figure out what to do with all the newly unemployed.

* Technology Spread is based on your Literacy rate. Higher literacy and a free press will cause techs that are spreading to you from outside to spread faster. This is separate from Innovation Points, which you invest directly into a single tech you are trying to research at a given moment.

* Innovation Points you can spend directly come from building universities and employing Academics. Literacy rate affects how many of those points you can directly invest into research each week. So if you have a well-funded academic elite but low general literacy, you might not be able to spend all of your Innovation Points. These ""overflow"" Innovation Points beyond your direct investment cap will increase Tech Spread instead. So there's a balance between increasing Literacy, which speeds the adoption of outside ideas, and building academic infrastructure, which gives you more direct control over research. (This is a complicated system and we got to see it for like 30 seconds but I'm pretty sure I was able to get the general idea. I'm sure Martin can find me and yell at me if I'm wrong.)

* Ideas like Socialism, Anarchism, Egalitarianism, will increase the minimum Expected Standard of Living for ALL POPs once present in your nation, so you will need to provide them with more stuff to keep them happy. This might also increase attraction for Interest Groups that want broader suffrage or to abolish slavery, for example.

* Having Anarchism as your organizing principle produces no Authority, so you will have a very reduced ability to make changes to your country directly once you have switched over to it.

* Anarchists can implement a Council Republic government, which gives more Political Strength to Farmers and Machinists and opens up the Worker Cooperative production method, in which workers own their factories and collect dividends from them. This is distinct from USSR-style communism, in which the state controls the industries and (theoretically...) passes the proceeds on to the workers from the top down in the form of subsidies and social programs.

* If a revolution happens, you can side with the rebels. So you can be super duper capitalist on purpose, make life hell for all the workers, then switch sides when the socialists rise up. Neighboring conservative countries will be likely to step in and try to stop a socialist revolution.

* They want it to be playable without a lot of prior experience. It's a very complex game but it should be much more approachable than Vicky 2.

* Rather than a game where you learn how to play ""correctly"" by following a guide, the goal is for it to be the kind of game where you do what comes naturally and are able to easily understand why your actions led to certain consequences.

Why randomly choosing people to serve in government may be the best way to select our politicians,6816,philosophy,https://www.reddit.com/r/philosophy/comments/mwxg2f/why_randomly_choosing_people_to_serve_in/,1619190691.0,"So I'm a huge advocate of something known as **[sortition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sortition)**, where people are randomly selected to serve in a legislature. Unfortunately the typical gut reaction against sortition is bewilderment and skepticism. How could we possibly trust ignorant, stupid, normal people to become our leaders?

# Democracy by Lottery
**Imagine a Congress that actually looks like America. It's filled with nurses, farmers, engineers, waitresses, teachers, accountants, pastors, soldiers, stay-at-home-parents, and retirees. They are conservatives, liberals, and moderates from all parts of the country and all walks of life.**

For a contemporary implementation, a lottery is used to draw around 100 to 1000 people to form one house of a Congress. Service is voluntary and for a fixed term. To alleviate the problem of [rational ignorance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rational_ignorance), chosen members could be trained by experts or even given an entire elite university education before service. Because of [random sampling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sampling_\(statistics\)), a sortition Citizens' Assembly would have superior diversity in every conceivable dimension compared to any elected system. Sortition is also the ultimate method of creating a [proportionally representative](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proportional_representation) Congress. 

# The History of Sortition
Democratic lotteries are an ancient idea whose usage is first recorded in ancient Athens in 6th century BC. Athens was most famous for its People's Assembly, in which any citizen could participate (and was paid to participate) in direct democracy. However, the Athenians also invented several additional institutions as checks and balances on the passions of the People's Assembly.

* First, the Council of 500, or the Boule, were 500 citizens chosen by lottery. This group developed legislative proposals and organized the People’s Assemblies.
* In addition, lottery was used to choose the composition of the People’s Court, which would check the legality of decisions made by the People’s Assembly. 
* Most government officials were chosen by lottery from a preselected group to make up the Magistracies of Athens. 
Athens used a mixture of both election and lottery to compose their government. Positions of strategic importance, such as Generals, were elected. 

# The Character of Democracy
Athenian democracy was regarded by Aristotle as a “radical democracy”, a state which practiced the maxim “To be ruled and rule by turns” [2 pp. 71]. For Aristotle, “It is accepted as democratic when public offices are allocated by lot; and as oligarchic when they are filled by election.” 

Renaissance writers thought so too. In The Spirit of the Laws, Montesquieu states, “Voting by lot is the nature of democracy; voting by choice is in the nature of aristocracy.”

How is it that ancient and Renaissance philosophers understood democracy to be selection by lottery, while modern people understand democracy to be a system of elections? Democracy was redefined by Frenchman Alexis de Tocqueville while he travelled through the United States in the early 1800’s. Tocqueville was impressed by the equality of the social and economic conditions of Americans in the early years of the republic. Importantly, Tocqueville believed that the institutions of American “township democracy”, law, and the practice of the tyranny of the majority made America a land of democracy. Therefore he wrote and titled a book, Democracy in America, that redefined America as a democracy rather than the aristocratic republic which its founding fathers had desired. Tocqueville’s book would become a best-seller around the world. 

With Tocqueville’s redefinition of democracy that excluded the practice of lot, the traditions of democracy were forgotten and replaced with the electoral fundamentalism of today. From historican & advocate David Reybrouck, 

> “Electoral fundamentalism is an unshakeable belief in the idea that democracy is inconceivable without elections and elections are a necessary and fundamental precondition when speaking of democracy. Electoral fundamentalists refuse to regard elections as a means of taking part in democracy, seeing them instead as an end in themselves, as a holy doctrine with an intrinsic, inalienable value.” [1 pp 39].

Late political scientist Robert Dahl suggested that the ideal of democracy is the “logic of equality” [3]. Three techniques of democracy were developed in ancient times to move towards political equality: direct participation, the lottery, and the election. Today, with public distrust of democratic government at all-time highs throughout the entire world, perhaps it’s time we democratise our democracies. Perhaps it’s time to bring back the technique of democracy by lottery. 


# Real World Evidence

It would be absurd to try out a crazy new system without testing it. Fortunately, sortition activists have been experimenting with hundreds of sortition-based [Citizens' Assemblies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Citizens%27_assembly) across the world. The decisions they have come to have been of high quality in my opinion. For example:

 * The BC Columbia Citizens Assembly was tasked with designing a new electoral system to replace the old [first-past-the-post](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First-past-the-post_voting) (FPTP) system. The organizers brought in university experts. The organizers also allowed citizens, lobbyists, and interest groups to speak and lobby. Assembly members listened to all the sides, and they decided that the lobbyists were mostly bullshit, and they decided that even though the university experts had biases, they were more trustworthy. This assembly ultimately, nearly unanimously decided that Canada ought to switch to a [Single-Transferable-Vote](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_transferable_vote) style election system. They were also nearly unanimous in that they believed FPTP voting needed to be changed. This assembly demonstrates the ability of normal people to learn and make decisions on complex topics. 
 * In [Ireland](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Citizens%27_Assembly_\(Ireland\)), Citizen Assemblies were instrumental in the legalization of both gay marriage and abortion in a traditionally Catholic country. Ignorant politicians thought the People wouldn't be able to compromise on these moral issues, yet they certainly were, when you finally bothered to get them into a room together.
 * Recent 2019-2020 Citizen Assemblies in Ireland and [France](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Citizens_Convention_for_Climate) reached consensus on sweeping, broad reforms to fight climate change. In Ireland taxes on carbon and meat were broadly approved. In France the People decided to criminalize ""ecocide"", raise carbon taxes, and introduce regulations in transportation and agriculture. Liberal or conservative, left or right, near unanimous decisions were made on many of these proposals.

Unlike the much criticized People's Assemblies of Ancient Athens, modern Citizens' Assemblies operate on time scales greater than a single day or two of decision making, and use modern deliberative and legislative procedures. 


# Comparing to Elections

Sortition stands in stark contrast with what all elections offer. All electoral methods are a system of choosing a ""natural aristocracy"" of societal elites. This has been observed by philosophers such as Aristotle since ancient Greek elections 2400 years ago. In other words, all elections are biased in favor of those with wealth, affluence, and power. 

Moreover, all voters, including you and me, are rationally ignorant. Almost none of us have the time nor resources to adequately monitor and manage our legislators. In the aggregate as voters, we vote ignorantly, oftentimes solely due to party affiliation or the name or gender of the candidate. We assume *somebody else* is doing the monitoring, and hopefully we'd read about it in the news. And indeed it is somebody else - marketers, advertisers, lobbyists, and special interests - who are paying huge sums of money to influence your opinion. Every election is a hope that we can refine this ignorance into competence. IN CONTRAST, in Citizens' Assemblies, normal citizens are given the time, resources, and education to become informed. Normal citizens are also given the opportunity to deliberate with one another to come to compromise. IN CONTRAST, politicians constantly refuse to compromise for fear of upsetting ignorant voters - voters who did not have the time nor opportunity to research the issues in depth. Our modern, shallow, ignorant management of politicians has led to an era of unprecedented polarization, deadlock, and government ineptitude. 

# Addressing Common Concerns
## Stupidity
The typical rebuttal towards sortition is that people are *stupid, unqualified, and cannot be trusted with power*. Or, people are ""sheep"" who would be misled by the experts. Unfortunately such opinions are formed without evidence and based on anecdotal ""common sense"". And it is surely true that ignorant people exist, who as individuals make foolish decisions. Yet the vast majority of Americans have no real experience with actual Citizens' Assemblies constructed by lottery. The notion of group stupidity is an empirical claim. In contrast, the hundreds of actual Citizen Assembly experiments in my opinion demonstrate that average people are more capable of governance than common sense would believe. The political, academic, and philosophical opposition does not yet take sortition seriously enough to offer any counter-evidence of substance. Even in Jason Brennan's recent book [""Against Democracy""](https://press.princeton.edu/books/paperback/9780691178493/against-democracy), Brennan decides *not* to attack the latest developments in sortition, (though he does attempt to attack the practice of [deliberative democracy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deliberative_democracy) on empirical grounds, but I think he cherry-picks too much) and even suggests using sortition as a way to construct his epistocratic tests. 
Unfortunately until sortition is given real power, we cannot know with certainty how well they would perform. 

## Expertise
The second concern is that normal citizens are not experts whereas elected politicians allegedly are experts. Yet in modern legislatures, no, politicians *are not* policy experts either. The sole expertise politicians qualify for is fundraising and giving speeches. Actual creation of law is typically handled by staff or outsourced to lobbyists. Random people actually have an advantage against elected politicians in that they don't need to waste time campaigning, and lottery would not select for power-seeking personalities. 

## Corruption
The third concern is with corruption. Yet sortition has a powerful advantage here as well. Corruption is already legalized in the form of campaign donations in exchange for friendly regulation or legislation. Local politicians also oftentimes shake down small businesses, demanding campaign donations or else be over-regulated. Sortition fully eliminates these legal forms of corruption. Finally sortition legislatures would be more likely to pass anti-corruption legislation, because they are not directly affected by it. Elected Congress is loath to regulate itself - who wants to screw themselves over? In contrast, because sortition assemblies serve finite terms, they can more easily pass legislation that affects *the next* assembly, not themselves. 

## Opposition to Democracy
The final rebuttal is the direct attack against democracy itself, waged for millennia by several philosophers including Plato. With thousands of years of debate on hand, I am not going to go further into that fight. I am interested in advocating for sortition over elections. 


# Implementations

As far as the ultimate form sortition would take, I will list options from least to most extreme:

* The least extreme is the use of Citizen Assemblies in an advisory capacity for legislatures or referendums, in a process called ""Citizens Initiative Review"" (CIR). These CIR's are already implemented for example in Oregon. Here, citizens are drafted by lot to review ballot propositions and list pro's and con's of the proposals. 
* Many advocate for a two-house Congress, one elected and one randomly selected. This system attempts to balance the pro's and cons of both sortition and election.
* Rather than have citizens directly govern, random citizens can be used exclusively as intermediaries to elect and fire politicians as a sort of functional electoral college. The benefit here is that citizens have the time and resources to deploy a traditional hiring & managing procedure, rather than a marketing and campaigning procedure, to choose nominees. This also removes the typical criticism that you can't trust normal people to govern and write laws. 
* Most radically, [multi-body sortition](https://delibdemjournal.org/article/id/428/) constructs checks and balances by creating several sortition bodies - one decides on what issues to tackle, one makes proposals, one decides on proposals, one selects the bureaucracy, etc, and completely eliminates elected office. 

-------------------

**TLDR: Selecting random people to become legislators might seem crazy to some people, but I think it's the best possible system of representation and democracy we can imagine. There's substantial empirical evidence to suggest that lottery-based legislatures are quite good at resolving politically polarized topics.**

"Why I changed from Pro-Palestine to Pro-Israel as an Irish person. Please help correct anything I may have gotten wrong, or missed out.",691,Israel,https://www.reddit.com/r/Israel/comments/1hd9ncr/why_i_changed_from_propalestine_to_proisrael_as/,1734086866.0,"As an Irish Catholic, all of my family and friends are Pro-Palestine. Tbh I still wouldn't really say I am pro one side or the other, as it is a complex conflict and not like choosing sides in a football match. I feel sorry for innocent people on both sides. However, the more I learn, the more I sympathise with the Israeli perspective. I honestly think that the Pro-Palestine side is heavily reliant on 'buzzwords' which sound good on social media posts or when chanted on the streets, and twists a lot of the facts. For example, the way they frame the entire conflict is that of white settler-colonist Jews oppressing the poor indigenous brown people of Palestine. This resonates a lot with people in Ireland, who see it as equivalent to the long Irish struggle for national independence against the British. Indeed, people will point out that the British politician Balfour is a key figure behind both the partition of Palestine and the partition of Ireland/Northern Ireland. I now believe this to be a false equivalence.

This is my current understanding. It may be imperfect and please help correct me....

For a start, the majority of Jews in Israel aren't white. I think it's sad that this racial element is so important, but apparently it is. The Middle-Eastern, or 'Mizrahi' Jews are the largest Jewish group in Israel. They considerably outnumber the 'Ashkenazi' Jews, or Jews of European descendent. More importantly, even the Jews of European descendent ultimately trace their heritage back to the Levant. At the end of the day, Jews come from Judea and Arabs come from Arabia. This is an over-simplification. But it is true that Jewish culture and ethnicity has been in the Levant for at least 3,000 years. The Jews were exiled from their homeland by the Romans 2,000 years ago. The Romans renamed the land 'Palestine'; it is not an Arabic word. Arab culture and religion came in the form of conquest after the invention of Islam in the 7th Century. Arab Muslim conquerers built the Al-Aqsa Mosque and the Dome of the Rock over the ruins of the temple on the Temple Mount, the holiest site in Judaism. By now Arab/Islamic culture has been in the region for well over 1,000 years, so they should also be considered native.

Since the beginning of their exile 2,000 years ago, Jews have faced persecution wherever they went, either as 'Christ-killers', or as people who rejected the final Prophet, or later as racially impure. However, Jews never fully left their homeland, but remained a minority under centuries of Colonial rule by the Arab Caliphates and later the Ottoman Empire. Despite what most people in Ireland seem to think, the modern state of Israel was not created as a colony under British Imperialism. Jewish settlers began returning to their ancestral homeland to escape persecution in Europe from the late 1800's onwards, purchasing land from Arabs and from absentee landowners in Istanbul. They came as refugees, not conquerors. At that time Palestine was a backwater of the Ottoman Empire and its population was a faction of what it is today. Jewish settlers brought advanced agricultural and medical technology from Europe and helped transform the land and enable it to support a larger population.

The Jewish persecution ultimately culminated in the Holocaust and the murder of 6 million Jews, at which point the world agreed that the Jews should have their own state. The UN decided to vote the state of Israel into existence - as part of a 2 state solution - in 1948 (a vote from which Britain actually abstained). Instead of accepting the democratic decision of the majority of the world's nations, Israel's bigger more powerful neighbours (Egypt, Jordan, Syria, Iraq) decided to invade and try to wipe out the early state. Somehow Israel managed to win this war, but hundreds of thousands of Palestines were displaced as a result. My understanding is that many were told by the Arab armies to flee during the war and promised they would be able to return home after the inevitable destruction of Israel. On the Jewish side, hundreds of thousands of Jews in North Africa and the Middle East - who had been there since the time of the Roman exile - were forced by the governments of those countries to leave. For example, before 1948 Morocco had around 250,000 Jews and today it has less than 2,000. Iraq had 150,000 Jews, but today less than 5. Talk about 'ethnic cleansing'. The majority of the Jews of Israel today are the descendants of these refugees ('Mizrahi' Jews). I believe so much death and suffering could have been avoided if the Arab nations had accepted this 1948 partition plan.

Since 1948 Israel's Arab Muslim majority neighbouring countries invaded it 4 more times (6 days war, Yom Kippur War, etc.) and each time Israel has won. I believe a big factor in this is the effectiveness of military organisation in democratic states in contrast to authoritarian states. Since then, dictators in authoritarian regimes in the Middle East have had an incentive to keep the conflict alive in order to present themselves as champions of the Palestinian cause and distract from internal human rights issues in their own regimes. Therefore neighbouring countries have continued to deny subsequent generations of Palestinian refugees citizenship and equal rights. However, by 2023 Israel was in the process of normalising relationships with the Arab Muslim states in peace negotiations facilitated by Saudi Arabia. The greatest antagonist in the Middle East today (Iran) could not tolerate this, so planned for its proxies Hamas and Hezbollah to launch attacks on Israel beginning with the atrocities of Oct 7th.

This is where I believe the ability of an Irish person to understand the conflict breaks down completely. If we consider the 2 major groups of the Palestinian resistance movement to be the 'PLO' (Palestinian Liberation Organisation) and Hamas, I believe the average Irish person can see reflections of the 'IRA' (Irish Republican Army) in the PLO. They are non-state actors willing to use violent means to achieve regional nationalistic goals. A free and united Irish state, a free Palestinian state. Tbh I think the PLO are much more fanatical than the IRA and harder to negotiate with. In the 1970's - Black September - the PLO tried to assassinate the King of Jordan and started a civil war. They got kicked out of Jordan and moved to Lebanon where they started a civil war that transformed the country from one of the most stable countries in the Middle East to the Lebanon of today in which a third of the country is ruled by a terrorist organisation. 4 times the PLO were offered a 2 state solution, and everything they were asking for, and each time they rejected it. In the 1990s the PLO supported Saddam Hussein's genocidal persecution of the Kurds. In contrast, in the 1990s the IRA disarmed and accepted a peace agreement that would see Northern Ireland remain part of the UK until such time as - through democratic referendum - the majority of the population chose to leave the UK and reunite with the Republic of Ireland.

Unfortunately, I believe the PLO are still more reasonable actors than Hamas, who are not interested in regional nationalistic goals such as the creation of a Palestinian state, but follow a globalist ideology of Jihad. If I understand correctly, Hamas don't even believe in the concept of the nation-state and believe that humans shouldn't be divided into different nationalities; there should just be Muslims and non-Muslims. They seek to re-establish the Islamic Caliphate. The fanatical Shia Mullahs of Tehran - who train and fund Hamas, Hezbollah and the Houthis - believe that global conflict is a prerequisite for the return of the Mahdi and the end of the world. This includes key events in modern day Syria, Yemen and the return of the Jews to the Holyland (specifically Jerusalem). From an Irish perspective - concerned with regional nationalistic struggle - it is almost impossible to empathise with this point of view, or how organisations could seriously base their geopolitical strategy on such eschatological nonsense. For this reason, Irish people are completely blind to this aspect of the conflict. But this is exactly what Hamas and Hezbollah believe and why they can't be negotiated with. They live in a different reality in which life in the secular world is unimportant compared to the eternal hereafter. Hamas leaders have even declared that they love death as much as the Jews and Americans love life.

The IRA, as bad as they might have been, were motivated by nationalism, not religious fanaticism and would never have engaged in the kind of violence against women and children that was undertaken by Hamas on Oct. 7th. Many Irish people unfortunately see that day as an uprising similar to the Easter Rising of Irish rebels against the British government in Ireland in 1916. They can't see the conflict as anything but a nationalistic struggle against colonial oppression. Because how could anyone seriously believe in that kind of religious end-of-the-world religious nonsense? And this is what leads Irish people to view the conflict through the lens of the other key buzzwords; 'genocide' and 'apartheid' state. After all, the actions of the British government continuing to export food from Ireland during the potato famine were arguably genocidal, and Catholics remained second class citizens in the apartheid state in Ireland created by the Protestant Ascendancy of the 17th Century. Never mind that almost 20% of Israel citizens are Arab Muslim, some of which are lawyers, doctors, members of the Supreme Court. I believe that Arab Muslims in Israel have more rights and a higher quality of life than Arab Muslims in almost any other country in the Middle East. The benefits of living in a liberal democracy as opposed to living under a dictatorship or theocracy. And from what I understand the road signs are in Hebrew, Arabic and English, which would be a very unusual step for an apartheid state to take.

It might not be surprising therefore that there are thousands of Arab Muslim Israelis in the IDF, as well as other religious and ethnic minorities such as Christians and Druze, who know how much better their lives are under a democratic government than they would be under an authoritarian or Islamic government like Hamas. I don't know how they expect us to believe that an army is committing genocide against a specific ethnic group, when that army itself has thousands of soldiers from that same ethnic group. There were zero Bosniak Muslim soldiers in the Serbian army in the actual genocide in Bosnia in the 1990s. The numbers also don't add up. 2 million people in Gaza, 44,000 dead, half of which are Hamas terrorists. The death of a single innocent civilian is heartbreaking, but it is a tragically unavoidable part of war. I believe many on the Pro-Palestine side are naive regarding the difference between war and genocide. The absolute number seems low for a genocide (compared to other ongoing conflicts in the region; 600,000 dead in Syria, 400,000 dead in Yemen). Also the combatant:civilian death ration 1:1 or maybe 1:1.5, whereas a typical modern urban war involves more like 4, 5 or 6 civilian deaths for every 1 combatant.

The fact that so many people are fixated on the number of dead is also unusual I think, and not typical of any previous conflicts. I truly believe that if social media and smartphones had existed during WW2, many supporters of the Pro-Palestinian movement would have been posting videos on TikTok of German children being pulled from the rubble and saying 'We have to have a ceasefire now, too many German civilians have been killed. The Allies are clearly evil. Let's give the Nazis time to regain their strength and build up their technology, but we just have to have a ceasefire now.'

One side is completely based on buzzwords, street protests and social media 'influencers'. The depressing part is that no one has the time to look into the history or geopolitical and religious nuances of the conflict, it's so much easier to watch a short TikTok video with emotional background music, or shout buzzwords in a street protest. The likelihood I will be able to convince any of my friends or family to re-evaluate the nuances of the conflict are so close to zero as to basically not be worth attempting.","['**Note from the mods**: During this time, many posts and comments are held for review before appearing on the site.

On every level, it is an insane way to behave. The British government is actively sabotaging the work it has spent the past two years completing and then doing a victory dance.  
>  
> The problems all lie with something called the Irish backstop. You wouldn’t know it, given how deranged the party has become about it, but it is a Conservative idea. Their problem was simple: They wanted two contradictory things. On the one hand, the Brexit campaign during the referendum promised to “take back control” from Brussels. That meant returning regulatory decision-making to London. But on the other, it promised that everything would continue as before, with no effect on trade. That is impossible, because as soon as you take back regulatory powers, you have delays on the border with Europe.  
>  
>The whole issue with the border is based on the concept of trust. In the European Union, member states share laws, courts and enforcement procedures. They know that the rules on the slaughter of cattle, the electronic components of cars or the chemical compounds in children’s toys are all the same. They can take someone to court if something goes wrong, even if they’re in another country, because they have the same institutions. This creates trust. And that’s why goods cross over national borders freely, with no checks.   
>  
>That has been particularly crucial in Ireland. After years of conflict, [peace was reached](https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/136652/agreement.pdf)  in the ’90s on the basis of continued cooperation between the north and south of the island. And that meant, more than anything, an open border between the Republic of Ireland in the south and British Northern Ireland in the north.  
>  
>But then Brexit came and blew it all to pieces. Instead of grappling with the hard choices the vote required, May pretended that Brexiteers could have everything they wanted: London would [get back control ](https://www.politicshome.com/news/uk/political-parties/conservative-party/news/79517/read-full-theresa-mays-conservative)of regulatory decisions. And the border with Ireland [would stay open](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-northern-ireland-41365301). The fact that these two promises were incompatible was never addressed. She just kept on pretending that it was all possible and that people should have greater faith.

>There was a weird, and very un-British, quasi-religious undercurrent to all this — a sense that things would work if you just believed in them hard enough. Also discernable were a hatred of practical judgment and a bubbling tide of chest-beating jingoistic nationalism. Brexit was a political project based on the idea that identity politics could answer technocratic questions. If the technocratic question keeps proving problematic, you just need to have more faith in your identity. It was like trying to unlock a door with a slice of bread.   
>  
>That culture has not changed since the 2016 referendum. In the past week alone, three interviews exhibited the kind of fevered puritanism that Brexit has triggered. Conservative Member of Parliament Mark Francois responded to a letter from the German CEO of Airbus, warning that the company might move its factories out of Britain, by [tearing it up on live television](https://inews.co.uk/news/brexit/mark-francois-brexit-mp-airbus-tom-enders-letter-tv-video-german-bullying/) and saying: “My father, Reginald Francois, was a D-Day veteran. He never submitted to bullying by any German; neither will his son.” A former trade minister, Digby Jones, [claimed](https://twitter.com/bbc5live/status/1090587682453868544/video/1) that negotiations are facing difficulties because “the Remainers and especially the establishment elite have set about sabotaging Brexit.” One Brexit supporter [interviewed on the street ](https://www.joe.co.uk/news/brexit-supporter-bbc-food-217675)by the BBC about warnings from retailers over supply chains insisted that it would “do the country good” to go without food.  
>  
>For her first two years in power, May kept pace with this new political culture. She acted like everyone’s Brexit dreams would come true and no trade-offs would ever have to be made. And then, last summer, her Brexit strategy finally acknowledged reality.  
>  
>This involved the Irish backstop. It was an insurance policy. It said that sure, Britain could look for ways to maintain an open border with Ireland while taking control of regulatory decision-making. But if that failed, which it would, Northern Ireland, at least, would have to lock into the E.U.’s regulatory infrastructure so that the E.U. would know that the rules on things like cattle slaughter, the electronic components of cars and the chemicals in children’s toys were all the same. This would allow the border to stay open, without the need for checks. In essence, it promised that if the fairy tales failed, reality would take over, on a strict timetable.  
>  
>The plan was May’s baby. She negotiated it. She even demanded it be extended from Northern Ireland to the whole  United Kingdom. But it was just too much bleak practical reality for the Brexiteers. So when she brought it to the House of Commons almost three weeks ago, lawmakers smashed it into a million pieces, with [a historic government defeat](https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/europe/brexit-vote-2019/2019/01/15/8eb6579a-1816-11e9-b8e6-567190c2fd08_story.html?utm_term=.94f57ca1c21d).

>After she reeled for a couple of weeks, Tuesday night saw May finally regain some sort of initiative: She grabbed hold of an amendment floating around by Conservative lawmaker Graham Brady and tried to use it to her advantage.   
>  
>It was a very strange and pointless amendment. It said, in a not legally binding manner, that Parliament would back the Brexit deal if “alternative arrangements” were found for the backstop. What were these alternative arrangements? How do you promise to keep a border open while simultaneously not promising to keep a border open? Brady couldn’t say. Neither could the prime minister or any other member of her government. They had no idea what they were doing. They just needed some words, any words, that could win majority support in the Commons. The fact that the specific words they chose made no sense was an advantage: If the amendment had made sense, someone would have taken offense at its implications. This is the logic of fairy tale politics. The most common idea among Brexiteers is that they will use “high-tech solutions” to remove the need for checks at the border. But the technology they are wishing for does not exist anywhere on Earth. It is science fiction.  
>  
>Not only did Brady’s proposition have no meaning, it was common knowledge before it was voted on that it could not be delivered. The E.U. has closed the talks on the withdrawal agreement. It has made it quite clear that they cannot be reopened. And even if they could, the backstop  took nearly two years to negotiate. There are only two months left before Britain leaves the E.U. That’s not enough time to do whatever it was lawmakers voted for Tuesday night.  
>  
>That’s what made the debate so truly pitiful. It was a return to the world of fairy tales and hallucinations, of the kind of quasi-religious nationalist politics that have fueled the Brexit project from the start. British politicians were confronted with reality and given a chance to fix the problems with Brexit instead of pretending there weren’t any, and they once again fled back into mythmaking.  
>  
>The country is now on the verge of disaster. On March 29, unless something is done, Britain will fall out the European Union without a deal. That will affect every aspect of the economy. It’s likely to block cargo  at the border; pulverize agricultural exports; trigger shortages of food, medicine and radioactive isotopes; spark employment chaos by suddenly canceling the mutual recognition of qualifications between British and European institutions; halt the legal basis for data transfer overnight; and lead to massive and sudden flows of immigration in both directions. The list goes on and on. There is no part of society that is unaffected. And yet not only does the British political class not seem to understand the consequences of what it is doing, it is lost in populist fantasies instead of addressing the cold reality.

Its not as large scale as an amarican city would need, but they produce all the drinking water for two Caribbean islands. ', ""I would like to piggy back off that link you posted. If you read the response from Suzanne Sullivan, she gives good info on the new technology emerging regarding graphene filters. Currently one of the issues with desalination involves efficiency. It takes so much salt-water and so much electricity to produce drinkable water. With developments like nanoporous graphene, and better solar tech ( the newest tech involves multiple cells focusing on different light spectrums in place of one cell focusing on all in the same cell space) efficiency will go up making practicality higher as well as costs lower. The other issue sheer infrastructure. I think the best way to see a real world example of distribution costs is to look up those natural gas pipelines that run across the country. We see in the news all the time about leaks, expensive costs to build, encroachments on private properties, and end mile installation costs. Imagine a city like Los Angeles (pop. 4 million); according to the CA-LAO government website residents use 109 gallons a day per person in the warmer months. That's 436 million gallons per day. The biggest desalination plant operating today produces 228 million gallons a day in Riyadh and cost 7.2 billion to build. So we would not only need two of those just for LA, but enough real estate to place it as well as enough electricity to power it. Let's imagine how much power is needed to power 2 plants so they can produce 456 million gallons of water a day, just for LA. \n\nSo while the tech is available, the biggest limitation is efficiency. By being able to use a  cheap and efficient source of electricity, with improved filtering processes, one day we can remove the current limitations we face today. Right now desalination works for small applications (ships, oil rigs, rural populated areas) but in order to make it work for large desert cities like LA, we need to work on the above things first."", 'Desalination is mainly performed using reverse osmosis (RO) plants. The general principle of the process is pumping water into reverse osmosis membrane stacks (often reaching 60bar operating pressure), where the salts are filtered and desalinated water exits as a permeate at the end of the stacks. \n\n\nThe process of desalination (and therefore the costs of such a plant - including both equipment and operation costs) varies with water quality and, as expected, the desired water yield. Long story short, salt water is more expensive to process than brackish water, which in turn is more expensive than freshwater (obviously) due to higher pressures required, that translate to certain requirements for pumps, membrane types, etc, plus the fact that the yield is lower as salt content goes up. Last but not least, one should also consider that RO plants have certain requirements on the water that arrives at the intake of the RO. This means that sedimentation filters and possibly water softeners are required, contributing to the costs as well.\n\nClosing my comment, as far as water purification is concerned, EDI (Electrodeionization) is a relatively new technology, which is however mostly used as a follow-up to RO, to produce ultrapure water for, mostly, industrial use in, say, cosmetics etc.']",0.14127737933708084,0.44979808748465455,1

Farmers gather for protest over tax changes,58,northernireland,https://www.reddit.com/r/northernireland/comments/1gurrrr/farmers_gather_for_protest_over_tax_changes/,1732001211.0,"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/clygwpe17evo

18 November 2024
Thousands of farmers have come together to protest against planned changes to inheritance tax.
The event at the Eikon Exhibition Centre in Lisburn, organised by the Ulster Farmers' Union, was also attended by politicians as well as agricultural leaders.
Farmers say the cap of £1m on agricultural property relief (APR) announced in the Budget last month will see the next generation deterred from taking over family enterprises.
The rally was called ahead of national protests in London on Tuesday.
Earlier, a cross-party letter signed by all of Northern Ireland's MPs was sent to Chancellor Rachel Reeves.
The letter called on her to reconsider her plans to change APR, which reduces the amount paid when farmland is passed to the next generation.

Paul Crawford, from Islandmagee in County Antrim, brought nine-month old Rowan to Monday's rally.
""Already he will sit there and chat to the calves and the lambs all day long,"" he told BBC News NI.
""But if these sort of rules come in there might not be the opportunity for him to do that and carry that on.""
Catherine McAdoo, a young beef and dairy farmer, said: ""At the end of the day it's going to be the next generation that is going to deal with the consequences if it's not sorted.""

Before the event, farmer Martin Cunningham, who is among those set to be affected, spoke to BBC News NI.
Martin has always dreamed of taking on his family's farm in the Belfast Hills and building on what his great-grandfather started.
But he says the Budget announcement ending APR on inheritance tax has ended that.
""If this farm’s handed down to me, I'll have an incredible tax bill to pay,"" Mr Cunningham said.

""I'll have to sell land in order to pay that, I'm going to have to sell land over the value of £200,000,"" he said.
""It's not simple to sell land up here, it's either all or nothing.""
How is inheritance tax changing?
Since 1984, APR has allowed land used for crops or raising animals, as well as farm buildings, cottages and houses, to be exempt from inheritance tax.
From April 2026, it will only apply to the first £1m of the estate, with anything over that value taxed at 20% - half the usual rate.
Research by the Department of Agriculture, Environment and Rural Affairs suggests a third of farmers in Northern Ireland will be affected, with the dairy sector particularly badly hit.
How are the inheritance tax rules changing?
Published
30 October
The average farm in Northern Ireland is about 100 acres and land values have risen in recent years.
For Mr Cunningham, this means the value of his family's almost-200 acres alone puts the farm over the £1m tax-free bracket.
That's before any equipment, farm buildings and house are taken into account.

Impact on farming community
Speaking to BBC Radio Foyle’s North West Today programme on Monday, farmer Ian Buchannan said he believes changes to inheritance tax will be “the final straw that has broken the camel’s back” for many farmers.
Mr Buchannan, who has a farm outside Dungiven, County Londonderry, said he, like many other farmers, are very concerned over what this will mean for the future of farming in Northern Ireland.
“The return we get on an investment on a farm, say it is worth one million or two million pounds, whatever the farm value is, it is well known that the return on that is 0.5% net profit per year – which is peanuts,” he said.
“60%-80% of all farm income over the last 10 years in Northern Ireland comes from subsidies.""

“Farms are like parcels that are passed down; you don’t open it but you just pass it on – farms are not generally sold unless a [family] line dies out,"" Mr Buchannan said.
“This is incredibly tough for a lot of farmers and I do feel there is a lot of mental stress within the community.”
Farmers from across the UK are preparing for a rally in London on Tuesday, calling on the Chancellor Rachel Reeves to reverse the changes.
But the Treasury has rejected proposals that would soften the impact.
","['Where was this energy when the tories ruined the economy and cut social programs and took us out of the eu through lies and deception?', 'Struggling to find any sympathy for rich farmers who voted for Brexit and turned Lough Neagh into a fucking biohazard. Maybe sort out that mess first before asking for more government handouts.', 'Pretty impressive turnout!\n\nI’ve been surrounded by farms my entire life. Helped out on a few, have friends who are farmers and owned a few acres myself at one point. I could make arguments on both sides of the debate but I’m in favour of some sort of tax reform.\n\nI think farmers themselves should be concerned about implications of continuing to exempt farms from inheritance tax. There has been a continual trend of farm numbers decreasing / farm sizes increasing. In the past 30 years, the number of farms has fallen from 31,000 to 24,000 and average size has increased from 74 acres to 101 acres.\n\nThe farmers you see and hear being interviewed about these reforms allude to small, multi generational, barely profitable farms. I have a lot of sympathy for this and would be happy if tax thresholds were set to exclude this sort of farm.\n\nIf you live in the countryside and have been paying attention, you won’t have missed the growing numbers of incredibly large farms. There are 2 near me, each with at least 300 acres. They require employees to run them and, due to their size, can operate with economies of scale that make them much more efficient than the neighbouring small farm, much more profitable and in a position to buy up land where and when it comes up for sale. I would be entirely in favour of placing inheritance tax on this sort of farm.']",0.033012952655809794,0.38625913328294276,1

At 45 kilometers long (or 28 miles), this wedge-shaped island has some dramatic landscapes with its huge steep mountains and cliffs, rocky beaches with exceptional diving points and unique laurissilva forests. Its highest point Roque de los Muchachos stands 2,423 meters above the sea level (or 7,949 feet), which combined with La Palma's small area, makes the island one of the most prominent peaks in the world.

Because of this, La Palma counts with way less inhabitants than Gran Canaria and Tenerife (as well as a much higher unemployment rate).

# First disappearance; Pedro Pérez Martín. Friday, March 31st, 2017.

&#x200B;

46-year old [Pedro Pérez Martín](https://s1.eestatic.com/2019/04/27/actualidad/actualidad_394221412_121442796_640x854.jpg) lived in the small village of [Tijarafe](https://www.google.com/maps/place/38780+Tijarafe,+Santa+Cruz+de+Tenerife,+Espa%C3%B1a/@28.711677,-17.9573758,726m/data=!3m1!1e3!4m5!3m4!1s0xc6bf72b5c84d50f:0xba88f17ce50aaa10!8m2!3d28.7110909!4d-17.9561807). He was divorced, and had two daughters with his ex-wife. Pedro suffered from depression, and he was being treated with medication. He stood 165 cm tall (5ft5) and weighed 75 kilograms (165 pounds). Pedro worked as an excavator operator and lived alone at a small house in Tijarafe. He had moved in as a tenant on March 19th, barely a couple of weeks earlier.

&#x200B;

He was last seen near his residence the evening he went missing. That morning he left home to work, and returned home that same evening. Nothing out of ordinary happened at work, reportedly. Pedro then left home again, withdrew money from an ATM and went to buy some groceries. He was last seen in his way back home from the grocery store. Police broke into his home the following day, after his family reported him missing. While there were no signs of violence or anything amiss, they met with a strange scene in the kitchen.

&#x200B;

The bags with the groceries Pedro had bought the previous evening were on the kitchen table. Some of the perishable groceries and dairies had been already placed in the fridge, but many others hadn't, and were at room temperature inside the bags. It was as if Pedro had decided to leave while he was arranging his recently bought groceries, for some mysterious reason. Neither his cellphone nor his wallet were found at his residence. 

&#x200B;

Pedro's car was found shortly after in the town. It was abandoned with the keys on, properly parked. Inside the car was Pedro's wallet with all his ID documents. As for his phone, it was also found in the car. Later, his mobile net operator would tell LE that last activity on Pedro's cellphone took place shortly after 8 pm of the day he went missing.

&#x200B;

His youngest daughter [Yamilet](https://diariodeavisos.elespanol.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Imagen-de-la-hija-y-su-padre.jpg) (now 24-years old) believes Pedro didn't leave on his own volition; he was very involved on her life and her sister's. Besides that, Pedro was described as very methodical, a man of routines. She doesn't believe his mental illness played a role on his disappearance either, and has hired a PI to work on Pedro's case. Unfortunately the PI hasn't been able to find new clues about Pedro's whereabouts. Yamilet believes that he was met with foul play, although she cannot think of anyone who could wish harm to her father.

&#x200B;

A neighbor claims he had seen Pedro wandering alone around [this hiking trail](https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-dVnNKhWlOWw/Wjy2DUg5EYI/AAAAAAAADP8/6qfd-JvxvbkO4vQCjug5UBNh9yqO0AxngCLcBGAs/s1600/DSCF7699.JPG) nearby, the evening before his disappearance. According to this witness Pedro walked slowly and with his head hanging low *'as if he were pensive or ruminating'*.

&#x200B;

No trace of Pedro was found at the trail, nor anywhere else.

# Second disappearance; Alejandro Martín Pérez. Thursday, May 11th, 2017

&#x200B;

[26-years old Alejandro](https://tvlapalma.com/fotos/imagen.php?filename=fichero_4560_20170519.jpg&ancho=670&alto=380&corto=0) was a single father, raising a 4-years old son. He lived in[Los Llanos de Aridane](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Los+Llanos+de+Aridane,+Santa+Cruz+de+Tenerife,+Espa%C3%B1a/@28.6601515,-17.9133822,3662m/data=!3m1!1e3!4m5!3m4!1s0xc6bf2358587f017:0x871be36dd27c3aa3!8m2!3d28.6183515!4d-17.8998566) with his father. Just like Pedro Pérez, Alejandro was divorced too, and he was scheduled to appear in court -civil- along with his ex wife on May 12th (the day after he went missing).

&#x200B;

The last person to speak with Alejandro was [his mother, María del Mar](https://s1.eestatic.com/2019/04/27/actualidad/actualidad_394221413_121442838_640x360.jpg). He visited her on the evening of the 11th, leaving at around 5:30 pm. María del Mar didn't notice anything odd or amiss in her son's behavior, he looked completely normal.

&#x200B;

A witness placed Alejandro not far from Los Llanos de Aridane at around 8:00 pm. This person claims he saw Alejandro driving his car, a white Opel Corsa, down towards the shore. No further sightings of Alejandro were reported after that.

&#x200B;

María del Mar, a nurse, worked the evening shift of the 12th. She had also agreed to do the night shift too, replacing a coworker on a leave. She had sent Alejandro a WhatsApp message before leaving for work on Friday 12th. On the morning of Saturday 13th, after the end of her double shift, Alejandro hadn't even checked her WhatsApp message. María del Mar didn't think too much of this at first, because Alejandro had just purchased a new cellphone and she thought he may be still dealing with the settings. But soon she learned that Alejandro hadn't shown up to the court session the day before, so she tried calling him. However, Alejandro didn't pick his phone. Suspecting that something sinister could have happened to her son, María del Mar filed a missing person report that same morning, right after having worked 16 hours.

&#x200B;

The first disappointment came up right at the police station. The officer who took the missing person report tried to convince her that Alejandro had probably spent the night partying at some bar -that Friday a local football match was held- and maybe he had hooked up with a girl and he'd be at her place that Saturday. This officer, says María del Mar, was dismissive and just seemed disinterested in doing his job. nevertheless, the missing person report was filed.

&#x200B;

However, the problems didn't stop there; Alejandro's car was located on the evening of that day, just a few hours after the report was filed in. But for some reason the investigation didn't start until Monday 15th, which means that Alejandro's car and the surrounding scene was unprotected and unsupervised for almost 48 hours. As for the car, it was found at the coastal town of [Tazacorte](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Tazacorte,+Santa+Cruz+de+Tenerife,+Espa%C3%B1a/@28.6419544,-17.9375802,1453m/data=!3m2!1e3!4b1!4m5!3m4!1s0xc6bf394cd599fb5:0x787da7fbd465156a!8m2!3d28.6427162!4d-17.9331848), some 3 kilometers (2 miles) from where Alejandro lived. Just like in the case of Pedro's disappearance less than two months earlier, Alejandro's car had been abandoned with the keys on. The car had been abandoned at the entrance of an unpaved road leading to one of the many banana farms in the area. According to his family, this is not a place that Alejandro would normally be at. 

&#x200B;

[This is the exact place where the car was found, and in the exact same way it had been parked.](https://s1.eestatic.com/2019/04/27/actualidad/actualidad_394221414_121442875_854x640.jpg) Please note that the car depicted in the picture is not Alejandro's car, and it's only shown here for re-enactment purposes.

&#x200B;

There were no clues about Alejandro's possible whereabouts inside the car. Unlike in Pedro's case, his cellphone wasn't in the car, although his wallet was. 

&#x200B;

No trace of Alejandro was found on the banana farms, nor anywhere else in the surrounding areas. María del Mar believes that the police did a bad job with Alejandro's case, and she's been very involved in social media ever since, raising awareness and trying to find news leads that might solve the case. She says that it's unlikely that Alejandro would have just left on his own; he was very close to his son and those who knew him know that he wouldn't take any life-changing decision without telling any of his loved ones.

&#x200B;

María del Mar has been in psychiatric treatment since Alejandro went missing. She has placed [a little memorial plaque in the place where Alejandro's car was found.](https://s1.eestatic.com/2019/04/27/actualidad/actualidad_394221415_121442894_640x360.jpg) It reads *""Algún día, Alejandro""* (*""Some day, Alejandro""*).

# Third disappearance; Anthony Walton. Friday, August 25th, 2017

&#x200B;

[Anthony John Walton](https://s1.eestatic.com/2019/04/27/actualidad/actualidad_394221416_121442922_640x360.jpg) was born in London, UK, in 1950. His parents owned several pharmacies across Great Britain, which granted a very privileged upbringing for him. He studied at the University of Cambridge, but instead of taking part of the family business after graduation he winded up at La Palma, living an eccentric and bohemian life. It's not exactly clear when and how Anthony ended up at the island, but he used parto of the wealth he inherited from his parents (some €500,000, or $570,000) to buy [this rural house](https://s1.eestatic.com/2019/04/27/actualidad/actualidad_394221420_121443034_640x360.jpg) located in the very steep hills of the pine woods of Garafía, near a town named [Roque del Faro](https://www.google.com/maps/place/38728+Roque+del+Faro,+Santa+Cruz+de+Tenerife,+Espa%C3%B1a/@28.8033782,-17.8789514,694m/data=!3m1!1e3!4m5!3m4!1s0xc6bfaddd55d0b95:0x7da47de6aeae8048!8m2!3d28.801912!4d-17.8790998) in the northern part of the island.

&#x200B;

Anthony founded an extravagant microsociety up there in the mountains. They were mostly foreigners that shared the same hippy lifestyle than him. Anthony was rarely seen by the locals outside his community, and when he was seen he was often wearing unusual attires like skirts, or displaying painted fingernails. The main bond between Anthony and his friends was the arts, especially poetry and music. They were often partying and organizing concerts and recitals. Adding to Anthony's eccentric behavior, he had also [published poetry books](https://s1.eestatic.com/2019/04/27/actualidad/actualidad_394221857_121455370_640x854.jpg), bought another house (of course, away from civilization) plus some acres of land where he set some sort of music stage for his concerts.

&#x200B;

He didn't stop there. Anthony launched a self-published monthly fanzine titled *""El Papelito"" (""The Little Paper"")* in which he informed those interested on its contents -for free- about the plans and news involving his community; scheduled events, concerts, recycling guidelines and *""how to get in touch with* [*Pachamama*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pachamama)*""*. *""El Papelito""* was written in both Spanish and English (within the same edition) and its style was rather chaotic and overloaded, [as it can be appreciated on this couple of pages from one of its monthly editions.](https://s1.eestatic.com/2019/04/27/actualidad/actualidad_394221417_121442950_640x360.jpg)

&#x200B;

Anthony, then 67-years old, went missing on August 25th, 2017. One of his cohabitants at the house in the mountains found a handwritten note signed by him, in which Anthony said that he'd move to live the rest of his life in one of the numerous caves that can be found in the northern side of La Palma. However, no trace of Anthony was ever found, neither in any cave nor anywhere else. [His car (a silver Suzuki Vitara)](https://s1.eestatic.com/2019/04/27/actualidad/actualidad_394221418_121442987_854x640.jpg) was at the shoulder of an unpaved road nearby, but it contained no clues about Anthony's whereabouts. 

&#x200B;

According to one of his friends, a 32-years old Slovak man named Peter, by the time of his disappearance Anthony was broke, having barely some €3,000 left in cash -which he didn't take with him. He had spent lots of money carelessly through the years organizing the parties, buying expensive sound systems for the concerts, etc. But Peter -as well as many locals- also believe that many of his friends from the community had taken advantage of him. He also explained that Anthony's home was very deteriorated inside, and living conditions were quite bad. Peter added that Anthony had massive mood swings; *""one minute he was the nicest guy in the world and the in next one he could turn into an absolute prick"" (sic).*

&#x200B;

Anthony didn't leave any will in his farewell note, but Peter currently lives in the house with his Italian girlfriend. He also keeps in touch regularly with Anthony's brother, who lives in Ireland.

# What could have happened?

&#x200B;

Currently there are 176 unresolved missing person cases in Canary Islands. Most of these cases have taken place in the islands of Gran Canaria and Tenerife, which are the only ones with metropolitan areas and together, at 1.6 million people, make up for 75% of the archipelago's population, whereas La Palma's represents less than 4% of the total population. These three unsolved disappearances constitute significant outliers, given that not only they took place within a very short timespan, but they also happened in a place where, due to its small population, such events are exceedingly rare.

&#x200B;

Could they have had an accident in the wilderness or drowned in the ocean? Neither their families nor the investigators think so. Drowning is one of the main causes of accidental death in Canary Islands -with foreign tourists topping the list-, and plenty of disappearances have this event as a cause. However, these disappearances are often solved within a few days when the missing person's body is washed back ashore by the tide. Cases in which the bodies are never found are extremely rare.

&#x200B;

As for the mountains, most people going missing are eventually found as well; either alive and just a bit shaken (majority of them), or injured because of a fall in one of the island's canyons and ravines (a smaller, yet still significant proportion of these cases) or finally dead because of the same aforementioned cause (rare, but not unheard of). In all these cases groups of both LE officers and civilians covered the forest areas around where all three men went missing, yet these searches yielded no result at all. 

&#x200B;

[This well near the hiking trail where Pedro was seen wandering alone the evening before his disappearance was examined.](https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-quxK1_xFIm8/WjxtHGmbisI/AAAAAAAADPs/N5-6GqUEqx4Bjq9pF-c4mftMV4G-zZNBgCLcBGAs/s1600/DSCF7713.JPG) There was nothing on it.

&#x200B;

Anthony didn't seem to own a bank account (it seems that he kept all his money in cash), but Pedro's and Alejandro's are followed. However, no movement has been registered since they went missing.

&#x200B;

As for leaving the island on their own without being seen or leaving any clue behind; although possible, that's extremely difficult. La Palma has a very steep orography, most of its coast is surrounded by high cliffs measuring up to more than 300 meters high (1,000 feet). There are very few beaches or coves in which boarding a small boat is possible, and these are well known -and frequented- by locals. Some of these have developed ports, like in Tazacorte (where Alejandro's car was found).

&#x200B;

A possibility that has been raised has them leaving on the islands' ferry, hiding inside a car's trunk. Authorities rarely inspect a car reaching the other islands this way (with their sparse population, the western islands are not profitable for smuggling drugs at large scale). However, no trace of them has ever been found anywhere in the archipelago. This theory wouldn't explain why they would do such a thing; Pedro had just moved into a new home, and Alejandro was very involved in his son's life. This theory would also involve third parties in their disappearances, and there's no piece of evidence pointing at that.

&#x200B;

Foul play is not thought to be a likely cause for their disappearances, as literally no evidence of such a thing has been found during the investigations.

&#x200B;

The three cases are still open but the investigation is currently suspended due to lack of new leads or evidence.

[Local web press article (Spanish)](https://elsurcodigital.blog/2018/07/08/desaparecidos-una-busqueda-real/)  


*The Canary Island of La Palma has kept a secret for two years. In six dire months of 2017, three adult men, with no connection between them, disappeared. They searched for them on land and sea, even in caves, two did not leave a farewell note or warn anyone of their intentions, the other said that he was going to live as an anchorite but they also searched for him without finding him.*

*The three officially disappeared on the island of La Palma are Pedro Pérez Martín, 46, a native of Tijarafe, whose whereabouts are unknown since March 2017; Alejandro Martínez Pérez, 26, a resident of Los Llanos de Ariadne, who disappeared in May, and Anthony John Dalton, a 68-year-old British citizen, resident in Garafía who also lost track of August 2017.*

&#x200B;

*""It is strange that on an island like this there are so many disappearances, because they do not have as much movement as others in the archipelago and all the dissemination we give it is little,"" explains Santiago Carlos Martín, coordinator of SOS Disappeared in the Canary Islands, who also complains that in these cases ""we do not have specialized resources for exhaustive searches as there may be in the peninsula, the searches were carried out on foot with many volunteers and some police, but without many means, but perhaps the searches could have been started earlier.""*

&#x200B;

*La Palma, whose historical name is San Miguel de La Palma, is a Canary Island that has an area of ​​700 square kilometers and a population of around 80,000 inhabitants. The capital is Santa Cruz de La Palma, but the most populated municipality is Los Llanos de Ariadne, with about 20,000 inhabitants. It is located in the northwest of the island of Tenerife and has only a small airport and a commercial and sports port that unites this island with the rest of its Canary sisters. La Palma is also known as ""the pretty island"" for its lush vegetation all year round.*

&#x200B;

*The truth is that getting in and out of the island should be, presumably, difficult without being detected by authorities or closed circuit cameras. The island is lush and leafy, with mountains, ravines and in the center it has the Caldera de Taburiente National Park and has a 2,426-meter peak, the Roque de los Muchachos.*  


  
*However, for María del Mar Pérez, mother of Alejandro Martínez, it is much easier to leave the island undetected than someone who did not know the place would think, “because nobody checks the trunks of the cars that go by ferry or , for example, leisure boats or fishing boats that go from island to island ”.*

&#x200B;

*María del Mar still does not explain what happened to her son. ""He left on May 11, 2017 with his friends like every day and they found his car two days later, open, but without a trace of Alejandro. It took me more than half an hour to insist that they take the complaint, ”recalls María del Mar. Alejandro's profile corresponds to that of many missing people, young, without problems at home or at work and with children. ""I can't believe that Alejandro left voluntarily because he has a 6-year-old son whom he adores,"" says his mother.*

  


*Alejandro's car, who lived with his mother in Los Llanos de Ariadne, was found in Tazacorte, in the northwest of the island, far from the sea, open, with the documentation inside and without a trace of violence two days after the search began, ""In an area that even if it had fallen or thrown into the sea is not easy because it is an area where the cliff is far away and you cannot fall directly into the water."" In the Canary Islands 176 people have disappeared between 2010 and 2018 and 12,330 people throughout Spain in the same period.*

&#x200B;

*Alejandro was searched for 48 hours at first, then other more targeted searches were made, although no specialized units or K9 dogs were used, for example, specialists in the search for living people or corpses, a lack of resources of what they complain in SOS Disappeared, which has now managed to sign an agreement with the 14 municipalities of La Palma ""so that in the event of a disappeared we all know how to act, Local Police, volunteers, local radio and television,"" explains Santiago Carlos Martín.*

&#x200B;

*Alejandro was one of the three people who disappeared on La Palma in less than six months together with the British John Dalton, 68, who left a farewell letter announcing his intention to go live in ""a cave"", of the many that exist in the municipality of Garafía, although the neighbors looked for him in all these caves, very numerous in the area, and he was never found alive or dead. Different was the case of Pedro Pérez, 46, from Tijarafe, who disappeared in March 2017, who had withdrawn money from his account, left his purchase half placed at home and the car also open. Pérez had quite established routines and took medication, but his trace, like everyone else's, was lost on La Palma without leaving any signs.*  


&#x200B;

*Santiago Carlos Martín, from SOS Disappeared, adds that ""in La Palma we are currently looking for three people but there are more missing, although we do not know how many because the families are not advised and did not contact us at the time."" SOS Disappeared is a non-profit association that “only gives us to advise families and little else”, adds Martín, who makes a request: “We have to keep the search for these people active because, otherwise, they will be forgotten ”, Assures Martín.*","['Great write up.

He may well have wandered off in search of an inner peace or escape from his old life, only to fall/be overtaken by the August heat/consciously take his own life how we wanted to.

I\'m not going to suggest he was involved in criminality as it annoys me when people assume big bad criminals are everywhere and ready to kill over a minor drug deal/theft or whatever, but farm can be a big place and who knows who else he met there, or went to meet.

Also, I just tried to post this as a single post and got told that there was a character limit of 40k, which I didn't know before, so my conclusions are all in this post, as are the companies that would have had difficulty halting or been entirely unable to do so, but the companies that easily could have halted based on their daily highest and lowest prices will be in part 2.

[For those who haven't seen my posts for the last 6 months, I have been tracking Limit Up Limit Down Halts market wide since the end of July](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/10iqp9a/pretty_calm_short_trading_week_in_terms_of_halts/)  I have a few more important posts buried in the first bit of that post going back a bit further.  [My first post on this topic was my analysis of every stock that had even a single LULD halt between Jan 27 and Jan 29 of 2021.](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/vcsnj2/an_analysis_of_every_stock_that_had_an_luld_halt/)  I figured at the time that I might be able to find other tickers possibly in the swap basket.

A big issue that I have started to run into with all of my posts recently is just the honestly quite large task of converting my excel spreadsheets into a digestible format, and if any apes have skills in web development and would like to help me make a website that automatically scrapes data from a couple other websites and then compiles it into a readable format automatically that would be greatly appreciated.

Ok, I think that gets all of the intro out of the way, let's get into the data now 

First, let's get into the more simple facts of what happened and was recorded on [the NYSE halt tracking page](https://www.nyse.com/trade-halt-current)

1. There were 78 different tickers that all halted at exactly 09:30:15 EST (15 seconds after market open)
2. there were another 5 tickers that halted in the first minute of trading, the first ticker to halt later than 09:30:15 was swapcorn, which halted at 09:30:16
3. LULD halts will almost always be either exactly 5 or 10 minutes long (based on my data going back to August 2019), out of the 83 tickers that halted in the first minute of trading, only 10 of them had an even 5 or 10 minute duration, the remaining 73 tickers had seemingly random durations, mostly between 5 and 10 minutes, but quite a few were longer than 10 minutes.

[here is the excel spreadsheet that I used in case anyone wants to check it.  Column's A-H are a copy and paste from the .csv off the NYSE halt page, but sorted according to start time.  Column K subtracts the start time from the end time in order to determine the duration of the halt, Column L checks that the start and end dates match (not an issue here, but I have seen it before).  Column O is a manual entry of the market cap of that company from yahoo finance, and column Q is a manual entry of the country where the company is headquartered.](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1mPhtLJUH9TjonJux1MAwKAzusCY5ILwB/edit?usp=share_link&ouid=104304488697756019170&rtpof=true&sd=true)

I manually calculated maximum percentages for each ticker based on the daily price range from yahoo finance using the following equations

* Maximum upward movement percentage= 100\*(Highest price of the day -Lowest price of the day)/Lowest price of the day
* Maximum downward movement percentage = 100\*(Lowest price of the day-Highest price of the day)/Highest price of the day

These equations will always return a smaller absolute percentage for downward movement for downward movement than for upward movement because the denominator in the downward movement is always going to be higher than the denominator of the upward movement.  Also, this is literally the largest percentage that could have happened if the entire day's action happened in the first minute of trading, it is likely that the companies didn't actually hit the percentages posted in the first minute, but they could not have possibly get higher percentages than reported here.

Now to summarize what is in the remainder of this post

1. Oil and Gas was the most common type of company to show up (16 out of 83 halts in the first minute were on companies in that area
2. Financial companies were tied with Oil and Gas (also 16 out of 83 halts)
3. The combined market cap of all the companies that were halted in the first minute of trading was 6.23 Trillion dollars
4. 69 (heh, nice) out of the 83 companies are based in the US, but the other 14 were spread across the UK (3) Taiwan (1), Canada (3), Switzerland (2), Chile (1), Denmark (1), Japan (1), China (1) and Ireland (1)
5. A considerable number of the tickers (35/83) either would have had to go from their lowest price of the day to the highest price of the day, or literally could not have halted in either direction because there isn't a large enough difference in the reported numbers on yahoo
6. There was a single company out of the 83 where both of the percentage calculations returned very even fractions (1/2 and 1/3, no rounding on either) which just seemed super odd.  Additionally, I am pretty sure I remember some talk on the OG sub after the sneeze about that company, also they literally develop software for the more shadowy 3 letter agencies in the US government so there is also that...

OK, so here are all the tickers that halted during the glitch, that probably shouldn't have halted based on their price ranges over the entire trading day.  The rest of the tickers are in part 2 of this post

&#x200B;

All of the following are formatted as follows

* ""Company Name (ticker) - Sector/Industry - country  of headquarters -  data about today's movements and company market cap""
* The first company on this list is the one described in the previous point 6

*Palantir Technologies Inc. class A Common Stock (PLTR) - defense/software - US - halt started at 09:30:15 and lasted exactly 10 minutes (only the third ticker on this list to have a normal halt duration).  The closing price yesterday was $7.38, the open price was $8.76, and the daily range was $5.84 to $8.76 (open).  The reported range would definitely allow for halts in either direction (+50.00% or -33.33%).  The weird thing here is that those percentages are actually really simple fractions (+1/2, or -1/3) and I didn't have to do any rounding to get those fractions.  Additionally, I could swear I remember some talk about this company on the OG sub for a few months after the sneeze.  This ticker had a market cap of 14.60 Billion as of 1/20*

Omega Healthcare Investors, Inc. (OHI) - Real Estate - US - halt started at 09:30:15, and lasted 11 minutes and 35 seconds.  According to yahoo finance, it closed yesterday at $28.70, opened today at $28.79, and had a range between $28.40 and $31.26, the lower price shows up on the ticker, but the ticker doesn't show a price above $29.33.  This price range would have barely hit a 10% change, but only if it was a limit up halt 100\*(31.26-28.4)/28.4=10.07% (halt), 100\*(31.26-28.4)/31.26=9.15% (no halt).  The current market cap of OHI is 6.60 Billion as of 01/20.

Oneok, Inc. (OKE) - Energy (oil/gas) - US - halt started at 09:30:15 and lasted 10 minutes and 9 seconds.  According to yahoo finance, it closed yesterday at $69.73, opened today at $67.59, and had a range between $64.49 and $69.71.  Neither direction of halt would have hit the 10% threshold with this range (+8.23% or -7.60%).  Additionally, the yahoo ticker does not show a price below $67.33 on the daily.  The current market cap of OKE is 31.16 Billion as of 01/20.

Unilever plc (UL) - Consumer Defensive (Household and personal) - UK - halt started at 09:30:15 and lasted 9 minutes and 47 seconds.  According to yahoo finance, it closed yesterday at $50.90, opened today at $50.49, and had a daily range between $50.09 and $50.80.  A halt in either direction would not have been remotely feasible with this range (+1.42% or -1.40%).  The current market cap of this ticker was 127.36 Billion as of 01/18.

Toronto Dominion Bank (TD) - financial services (banks-diversified) - Canada - halt started at 09:30:15 and lasted 7 minutes and 23 seconds.  According to yahoo finance, it closed yesterday at $67.04, opened today at $66.00 and had a range between $66.50 and $67.42.  A halt in either direction would not have been remotely feasible with this range (+1.38% or -1.36%).  The current market cap of this ticker was 116.64 Billion as of 10/31/2022.

Prudential Financial, Inc. (PRU) - financial services (life insurance) - US - halt started at 09:30:15 and lasted 6 minutes and 53 seconds.  According to yahoo finance, it closed yesterday at $99.99, opened today at $99.24 and had a daily range of $91.96 and $101.15, although there don't appear to be any prices below around $97.50 on the ticker.  A halt up could have barely been possible (depending on rounding and precision), but a halt down wouldn't be possible with this range (+9.99% or -9.09%).  the current market cap of this ticker was 36.30 Billion as of 01/20.

The Southern Company (SO) - Utilities (regulated electric) - US - halt started at 09:30:15 and lasted 9 minutes and 12 seconds.  According to yahoo finance, it closed yesterday at $66.86, opened today at $58.85 and had a daily range of $65.84 and $71.18 which doesn't make sense because the open is way lower than the lowest number in the range.  The range from yahoo wouldn't allow for a halt (+8.11% or  -7.50%), however if we use the open number from yahoo instead it would have been possible to halt in either direction (+22.02% or -18.05%).  The current market cap of this ticker was 74.03 Billion as of 9/30/2022

Eli Lilly & Co. (LLY) - Healthcare (general drug manufacturer) - US - halt started at 09:30:15 and lasted 8 minutes and 10 seconds.  According to yahoo finance, it closed yesterday at $342.21, opened today at $384.44, and had a daily range of $340.00 and $365.22.   A halt in either direction should not have happened with the reported daily range (+7.42% or -6.91%).  The current market cap of this ticker was 307.24 Billion as of 9/30/2022

Toll Brothers, Inc. (TOL) - Consumer cyclical (residential construction) - US - halt started at 09:30:15 and lasted 18 minutes and 41 seconds.  According to yahoo finance, it closed yesterday at $56.04, opened today at $63.19 and had a daily range of $54.71 and $60.03 which doesn't make sense because the opening price is higher than the highest price in the range.  The range from yahoo wouldn't allow for a halt (+9.72% or 8.86%), however if we use the open number from yahoo instead it would have been possible to halt in either direction (+15.50% or -13.42%).  The current market cap of this ticker was 4.72 Billion as of 10/31/2022.

Novo-Nordisk A/S (NVO) - healthcare (biotech) - Denmark - halt started at 09:30:15 and lasted 12 minutes and 33 seconds.  According to yahoo finance, it closed yesterday at $141.08, opened today at $144.78 and had a daily range between $137.50 and $144.78 (open).  The reported range would not even come close to allowing for a halt (+5.29% or -5.03%).  The current market cap of this ticker was 316.37 Billion as of 1/20

ISTAR INC. (STAR) - Real Estate (diversified) - US - halt started at 09:30:15 and lasted 5 minutes and 54 seconds.  According to yahoo finance, it closed yesterday at $8.71, opened today at $8.35, and had a daily range between $7.30 and $8.92.  The reported range would allow for a halt going up , but I suspect not down since I suspect this is in the +/-20% class of stocks (+22.19% or -18.16%).  The current market cap of this ticker was 0.76 Billion as of 1/20.

Sony Group Corporation American Depositary Shares (SONY) - Technology (consumer electronics) - Japan - halt started at 09:30:15 and lasted 9 minutes and 25 seconds. According to yahoo finance, it closed yesterday at $88.91 and opened today at $89.01.  The reported daily range was $88 to $89.99.  The reported range would not even come close to allowing for a halt in either direction (+2.26% or - 2.21%).  The current market cap of this ticker was 109.93 Billion as of 1/20.

Skeena Resources Limited (SKE) - Basic materials (metal mining) - Canada - halt started at 09:30:15 and lasted 9 minutes and 12 seconds.  According to yahoo finance, it closed yesterday at $6.13, opened today at $5.28 and had a daily range of $5.28 (open) to $6.43.  The reported range would allow for only a limit up halt since I suspect this is in the +/-20% class of stocks (+21.78% or 17.88%).  The current market cap of this ticker was 0.47 Billion

 Volta Inc. (VLTA) - Consumer Cyclical (EV charging stations) - US - halt started at 09:30:15 and lasted exactly 5 minutes (second ticker on this list with a normal duration).  According to yahoo finance, it closed yesterday at $0.8671, opened today at $0.7742 and had a range of $0.7742 (open) to $0.8612.  According to this range, this ticker should not have halted since it would only allow for a (+11.24% or -10.10%).  The price of this ticker is less than a dollar per share, and the market cap is only a few hundred million, so it should have needed at least +/-20% if not 40%.  This company is also being purchased by Shell at a price of $0.86/share so anyone who got shares at $0.7742 is practically guaranteed a decent gain.  Something definitely seems suspicious here, also, spoilers, Shell is gonna be showing up on this list a bit later.

Shell plc American Depositary Shares (SHEL) - Energy (oil/gas) - UK - told you this was gonna show up.  Halt started at 09:30:15 and lasted 6 minutes and 6 seconds.  According to yahoo finance, it closed yesterday at $58.63, opened today at $56.26 and had a daily range between $56.26 (open) and $58.40.  The daily range would not even come close to allowing for a halt in either direction (+3.80% or -3.66%) so something could be up here.  the market cap of this ticker was 204.45 Billion as of 1/20

Nucor Corporation (NUE) - Steel manufacturer - US - Halt started at 09:30:15 and lasted 9 minutes and 38 seconds.  According to yahoo finance, it closed yesterday at $153.85, opened today at $153.07 and had a daily range of $150.50 to $163.53.  The daily range would not allow for a halt in either direction (+8.66% or -7.97%) so something could be up here.  The market cap of this ticker was 39.37 Billion as of 1/20.

Rio Tinto plc (RIO) - Basic Materials (mining) - UK - halt started at 09:30:15 and lasted 12 minutes and 11 seconds.  According to yahoo finance, it closed yesterday at $78.76 opened today at $79.83 and had a range between $77.29 and $79.83.  The daily range would not even come close to allowing for a halt in either direction (+3.28% or -3.18%), so something is up here.  The market cap of this ticker was 123.52 Billion as of 1/18

Destra Multi-Alternative Fund (DMA) - Mutual fund - US - Halt started at 09:30:15 and lasted 8 minutes and 30 seconds.  According to yahoo finance, it closed yesterday at $6.84, opened today at $8.77, and had a daily range between $6.77 and $6.85 which doesn't make sense because that is much lower than the opening price.  The ""official"" range from yahoo would not even come close to allowing for a halt (+1.18% or -1.17%), but if we use the opening price as the upper price we get (+29.54% or -22.81%) which would allow for a halt even at the +/-20% level of stock, which I suspect is where this ticker is with a market cap of only 0.06 Billion as of 1/12.

Silvergate Capital Corporation (SI) - Financial Services (Bank) - US - halt started at 09:30:15 and lasted exactly 5 minutes (4th ticker to have a normal halt duration).  The closing price yesterday was $16.03, the opening price today was $14.17, and the daily range was $14.17 to $17.23.  This range would allow for a halt up, but not down, assuming it had a +/-20% requirement (+21.59% or -17.76%).  This company had a market cap of only 0.43 Billion as of 1/19 and has been having some major issues related to the FTX implosion so probably worth looking into a bit further.

MetLife Inc. (MET) - Financial Services (Life Insurance) - US - halt started at 09:30:15 and lasted 6 minutes and 31 seconds.  The closing price yesterday was 70.69, the opening price was $64.79, and the daily range was $64.79 (open) to $71.27.  Depending on rounding and precision, it is possible that a limit up halt could have happened, but a limit down should not have happened using the reported daily range (+9.97% or 9.07%).  This company has a market cap of 55.07 Billion.

Nine Energy Service, Inc. (NINE) - Energy (Oil/Gas equipment and services) - US - halt started at 09:30:15 and lasted exactly 5 minutes (5th company to have a normal halt duration).  The closing price yesterday was $13.38, the opening price was $13.51, and the reported range was $11.97 to $13.51. This reported range would allow for a halt in either direction if it had a +/-10% limit (+12.87% or 11.40%).  This company had a market cap of only 0.49 Billion as of 1/21, so it may actually be in the +/-20% category which would make it so the halt didn't make sense.

The Scotts Miracle-Gro Company (SMG) - Basic Materials (agriculture inputs) - US - halt started at 09:30:15 and lasted 5 minutes and 40 seconds.  The closing price yesterday was $64.15, the opening price was $68.29, and the reported range was $62.02 to $68.29 (open).  The reported range would only allow for a halt up, and not down (+10.11% or -9.18%).  This company had a market cap of 3.46 Billion as of 1/20.

NuScale Power Corporation (SMR) - Industrials (modular nuclear reactors) - US - halt started at 09:30:15 and lasted 5 minutes and 33 seconds.  Previous close was $10.30, open today was at $11.32, daily range was $10.22 to $11.32 (open).  This range would only allow for a halt up, but not down (+10.76% or -9.72%).  The company only has a 0.54 Billion market cap as of 1/18 though so it is possible that it would have required +/- 20% to halt which would mean this halt didn't make sense.

Truist Financial Corporation (TFC) - Financial Services (bank) - US - halt started at 09:30:15 and lasted 7 minutes and 10 seconds.  Previous close was $48.84, open was $51.26, daily range was $48.10 to $53.34.  This range would allow for a limit up halt but not a limit down (+10.89% or -9.82%).  The company has a market cap of 63.58 Billion as of 1/19.

Wayfair Inc. (W) - Consumer cyclical (internet retail) - US - halt started at 09:30:15 and lasted 8 minutes and 11 seconds.  Previous close was $59.33, open was $56.41, and daily range was $54.42 to $60.42.  this would put the maximum movement at (+11.03% or -9.93%) which means it only could have halted up and not down.  The company had a market cap of 5.01 Billion as of 1/20.

W.R. Berkley Corporation (WRB) - Financial Services (property and casualty insurance) - US - halt started at 09:30:15 and lasted exactly 5 minutes (6th ticker to have a normal duration here).  Previous close and open were both $70.33, daily range was $69.48 to $75.53.  This range does not allow for a halt in either direction (+8.71% or -8.01%).  The company had a market cap of 18.56 Billion as of 1/20.

Ametek, Inc. (AME) - Industrials (electronics) - US - halt started at 09:30:15 and lasted 8 minutes and 34 seconds.  Previous close was $143.05, open was $143.38, daily range was $140.78 to $144.47.  This range does not allow for a halt in either direction (+2.62% or -2.55%).  The company had a market cap of 32.73 Billion as of 1/20.

Prologis, Inc. (PLD) - Real Estate (industrial) - US - halt started at 09:30:15 and lasted 14 minutes and 54 seconds.  Previous close was $126.07, open was $122.29, daily range was $115.50 to 126.99.  The daily range would not allow for halts in either direction (+9.95% or -9.05%).  The company had a market cap of 113.37 Billion as of 1/21.

PennantPark Floating Rate Capital Ltd. (PFLT) - Financial Services (Asset Management) - US - halt started at 09:30:15 and lasted 7 minutes and 4 seconds.  Previous close was $11.81, open was $9.93, and daily range was $9.72 to $11.70.  This would allow for a halt up, but not down at the 20% threshold that I suspect this stock sits at (+20.37% or 16.92%).  the company only has a market cap of 0.53 Billion, as of 1/20 and seems to be having some issues with debt that it intends to resolve by diluting it's shares.

PHILLIPS 66 (PSX) - Energy (Oil/Gas) - US - halt started at 09:30:15 and lasted 7 minutes and 27 seconds.  Previous close and open were both $106.94, daily range was $98.96 to $107.26.  This range would not allow for a halt in either direction (+8.39% or -7.74%).  The company has a market cap of 50.55 Billion as of 1/20.

TC Energy Corporation (TRP) - Energy (Oil/Gas) - US - halt started at 09:30:15 and lasted exactly 5 minutes (9th and last normal duration out of the 78 tickers that all had a halt start at 09:30:15).  Previous close was $43.51, open was $43.59, and daily range was between $42.59 and $45.18 which is not enough to halt in either direction (+6.08% or -5.73%).  the company has a market cap of $43.09 Billion as of 1/20.

Textron, Inc. (TXT) - Industrials (Aerospace & Defense components) - US - halt started at 09:30:15 and lasted 12 minutes and 16 seconds.  Previous close was $68.98, open was $71.42, and daily range was between $68.00 and $71.42 (open) which shouldn't have allowed for any halts (+5.03% or -4.79%).  The company has a market cap of 14.17 Billion as of 1/21.

Main Street Capital Corporation (MAIN) - Financial Services (Asset Management) - US - halt started at 09:30:15 and lasted 9 minutes and 54 seconds.  Previous close was $39.58, open was $40.88, and daily range was between $39.00 and $40.88 (open) which should not have allowed for a halt in either direction (+4.82% or -4.60%).  The company has a market cap of 3.02 Billion as of 1/20.

3M Company (MMM) - Industrials (many different industries) - US - halt started at 09:30:24, so still in the first minute of trading, but not at the same time as any other ticker.  The halt lasted 7 minutes and 50 seconds.  Previous close was $122.62, open was $116.04, and daily range was between $114.50 and $120.00.  This range should not have allowed for a halt in either direction (+4.80% or -4.58%).  The company has a market cap of 66.69 Billion as of 1/20.

Morgan Stanley (MS) - Financial Services (Capital Markets) - US - halt started at 09:30:25.  The halt lasted 7 minutes and 11 seconds.  Previous close was $97.13, open was $96.28, and daily range was between $89.14 and $96.81.  This range should not have allowed for a halt in either direction (+8.60% or -7.92%).  The company has a market cap of 161.20 Billion as of 1/19.

ChargePoint Holdings, Inc. (CHPT) - Car charging - US - halt started at 09:30:30.  the halt lasted 8 minutes and 11 seconds.  Previous close was $11.87, open was $11.45, and daily range was between $11.34 and $11.98 which should not have allowed for a halt in either direction (+5.64% or -5.34%).  The company has a market cap of 4.08 Billion as of 1/18.","[""[Why GME?](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/qig65g/welcome_rall_looking_to_catch_up_on_the_gme_saga/) || [What is DRS?](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/ptvaka/when_you_wish_upon_a_star_a_complete_guide_to/) || Low karma apes [feed the bot here](https://www.reddit.com/r/GMEOrphans/comments/qlvour/welcome_to_gmeorphans_read_this_post/) || [Superstonk Discord](https://discord.gg/hZqWV2kQtq) || [GameStop Wallet HELP!

France is the quintessential Western European country,686,2westerneurope4u,https://www.reddit.com/r/2westerneurope4u/comments/16091c1/france_is_the_quintessential_western_european/,1692899493.0,"Okay, hear me out before y'all start madly French bashing at this blatant display of Francocentrism :

We are Celtic, Latin and Germanic. All three major Western European components. We also have Scandinavian blood in Normandy. We even have a part of the Basque Country, to add a weird genetic and linguistic isolate for good measure (sorry Finns). 

Northern France is culturally almost Northern Europe, Southern France is culturally almost Southern Europe, with all the gradual nuances and flavors of the spectrum between the two of them. 

Like Portugal and Ireland, we enjoy the Atlantic Ocean. Like Spain and Italy, we enjoy the Mediterranean Sea. Like the UK, we enjoy the Channel. Like the UK, Belgium, the Netherlands, Germany, Danemark and Norway, we enjoy the North Sea.

Like Switzerland, Italy and Austria, we have the Alps. Like Spain, we have the Pyrenees. Like Germany, we have some fertile humid hilly plateaus, at times wild and wooded, at times agricultural. Like Spain, we have some arid hilly plateaus. Like Spain and Italy, we have the different Mediterranean steps of vegetation. Like Danemark and the Netherlands, we have some damp oceanic plains. Like the UK and Ireland, we have shitty weather in Brittany and Normandy (jk, I meant oceanic pasture lands and bocage).

All this diversity in climates and geography is reflected in the cultures, architecture and traditions and most importantly, culinary traditions of the different regions.

We are part of potato Europe aswell as of tomato Europe. We are part of olive oil Europe aswell as of butter Europe. We grow and eat pretty much everything that can be grown anywhere else in Western Europe, because we have every climates and soils available.

 The three Western European traditional drinks are Wine, Beer, Cider (mhm. Latin, Germanic, Celtic ?) and we have all three of them : Beer is the preferred, traditional drink in Nord-Pas de Calais, Picardie, Alsace. Cider in Normandy and Britanny. Wine, well... We also have our fair share of liquors, distillates, schnaps and mountain plant liquors. 

We not only have the Celtic, Latin and Germanic components at core, but also as regional languages. Celtic being represented by Breton (Breizhoneg), Germanic by Alsatian (Elsässisch), Latin by French and its dialects, Arpitan, and Occitan and its dialects, which is the missing link in the Romance continuum, the most neutral language between French, Italian, Spanish and Catalan. 

I won't get too much into history, I'm not in a dick measuring contest, and there is too much to say. But sufficient to say that France for its 1000 years of existence continuously shaped, along with its neighbours, Western European History and thus the World. I'll limit myself to one of many examples : the Enlightenment along with the French Revolution and its ideals.

"Progress Report 142: Ireland, Part One",662,Kaiserreich,https://www.reddit.com/r/Kaiserreich/comments/1b417hf/progress_report_142_ireland_part_one/,1709316878.0,"Hello and welcome to the first Progress Report for Ireland! I am **El Daddy**, its current Developer, and am delighted to be writing this for you, as this rework has been a long time in the making.

First things first - Ireland has reached an advanced stage of development, where almost all the new content has been added, and we are at the point where we are tidying up text, balancing, checking for bugs and adding the finishing touches. This means that - while there is no release date yet - **Ireland is going to be in the next major release for Kaiserreich**, and all things going well, should be with you in weeks rather than months!

***

###Preface

So why the rework? Until the few cosmetic changes made with v1.0, Ireland’s political content is **some of the oldest extant in the mod**. Ireland is able to change its government, but outside of a few events, there is little narrative, and basically no difference in playing as the far left to the far right to everything in between. Expanding enormously on the political changes from v1.0, which updated some previous lore choices, the rework will showcase Ireland as a **vibrant multi-party democracy**, with unique content running the **full gamut of the political spectrum**.

In some ways, the fundamental premise of the rework remains the same as Ireland is currently, and indeed has been in Kaiserreich for many years - a relatively **conservative, democratic republic** led by war hero Michael Collins, next-door to its historical oppressor, which itself has undergone a massive political about-face. But now, deep into the development of Kaiserreich for HOI4, we get the chance to really delve into the intricacies of the nascent republic finding itself in the world, managing its multiple internal and external pressures, as well as coming to terms with both its history and geography.

What has always drawn me most to Ireland’s position in Kaiserreich has not been the composition of the state in 1936 - a **fully independent 32-county republic**, including the entire island. This is of course contrasting with our timeline’s situation in 1936, where Ireland was still a **member of the Commonwealth**, not yet a Republic, had a Governor General, and the British state still encompassed six of the counties of the island, as well as controlled key strategic ports. As interesting as the setup is, what I have always found more compelling has been that in the Kaiserreich timeline, the **Irish Civil War**, after the Anglo-Irish Treaty that ended the War of Independence in 1922, never transpired. This means that in the mod, we do not feel the lasting consequences of this short but **brutal and divisive conflict**.

For anyone even vaguely familiar with 20th century Irish history and politics, the fallout of the Civil War **dominated the political scene** for 100 years, and so to get the opportunity to imagine an Ireland where this simply did not occur was not something I could pass up on. The possibilities are considerable, as not alone do several key political and military figures not die or lose prominence during this time period, but also political parties are given a chance to develop along much **more conventional lines**. This is compared to our timelines’ major political allegiances, which were largely determined by what side one's antecedents fought on in the Civil War, rather than any actual ideology.

It would be fair to say that the development of the rework had its ups and downs. This rework’s very earliest iteration, to replace the previous legacy lore, came about in 2018, but after an early version of the lore and starting situation was put together and approved by the senior members of the team, the actual coding and implementation of these plans never really got off the ground. It lay dormant for a few years, until another developer picked it up, and began the process again, greatly tweaking the setup and refining the lore further. Around this time, I originally joined the Kaiserreich team as a lore advisor and writer, helping on deepening the political and gameplay situation for the rework plans, but over time have picked up coding and taken over as lead on the rework, leaving others to work on other countries that need their attention. We had one or two design changes early in this stage of development which set us back a bit, but the end result has been something I am very happy with, and greatly look forward to bringing to you all.

Let’s face it - Ireland is a small country, and one that is never going to be a major player. From a design point-of-view it is challenging, as it starts the game with all of its claims and cores, with no real areas it could wish to expand into. It is also relatively un-industrialised and has a low population - both of which not being great for a WW2-era war game. In an effort to make up for all of this, I made the decision early on to make sure Ireland offers a lot to players in other ways, namely through its **multiple unique interactions with other countries** and the world around it, and its **varied political setup**, which together will hopefully give players good reason to replay the country a few times. This theme of **variation** runs through the rework, with even the flavour events that fire throughout the game having different text or choices depending on the government in power.

To lay the groundwork, here is a summary of the lore and starting situation, starting slightly before Kaiserreich point-of-divergence in January 1917, and running up until game start in 1936. This lore is unchanged from that which has been on the wiki for the last while, but completely different from what is in-game, either before or after v1.0.

###Background Lore

In 1914, the Irish Parliamentary Party finally achieved its long-term goal of **Home Rule** when the British Parliament passed the Government of Ireland Act, giving increased autonomy to Ireland while keeping it a part of the United Kingdom. Ireland and Britain have shared a government since in 1801, when the Kingdom of Great Britain and Kingdom of Ireland merged to form the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland, removing any parliament from Ireland, and leading to great economic and social decline there. Unfortunately, the beginning of the Weltkrieg caused Westminster to delay the implementation of Home Rule indefinitely. Quieted tensions were brought back to the forefront. In 1916, the pro-independence Irish Volunteers plotted a national uprising with minor German material support. Dissent, indecision, and miscommunication among the revolutionaries, however, resulted in only a small group in Dublin taking up arms against the British. The **Easter Rising** saw intense fighting in the Dublin city centre, but it was swiftly crushed by the British Army.

Sixteen of the rebel leaders were immediately executed by military tribunal in what proved to be a fateful decision. The Easter Rising had not, initially, enjoyed strong popular support, but the brutality of the British response incensed the Irish public and led to a rapid **growth in support** for the revolutionary cause. This upswing of nationalism unexpectedly swelled the fortunes of **Sinn Féin**, until then a minor party led by founder Arthur Griffith that supported full Irish independence. In 1917, Sinn Féin shockingly won three by-elections and its MPs refused to take their seats in Westminster according to their policy of abstentionism.

After suffering defeat on the Western Front and desperate for manpower, in May of 1918 the British government instituted **conscription** in Ireland. This unpopular policy led to riots, and Sinn Féin’s new president **Eamon de Valera** declared a total boycott of the draft. For this, de Valera was arrested and imprisoned in England. As resistance to conscription only grew as the year drew on, Westminster decided to bring the promised home rule in hopes that it would mollify the nationalist opposition. Importantly, the **six counties in Ulster** where unionist sentiment was strongest would be exempted, a move much opposed by Irish nationalists.

In late 1918, the Home Rule elections were held; Sinn Féin won an overwhelming victory and the Irish Parliamentary Party was decimated. Sinn Féin organised its own parliament, **Dáil Éireann**, which declared itself to be the legitimate government of Ireland.

On the same day as the first meeting of the Dáil, a unit of the **Irish Republican Army**, Sinn Féin’s military arm, ambushed and killed two constables of the Royal Irish Constabulary. Though neither government ever made a declaration of war, this is generally considered to be the beginning of the **Irish War of Independence**. It became clear to the British government that the RIC was not up to the task of fighting the rebels, yet the army could not be deployed as a state of war in Ireland had not been declared because the government feared that to do so would grant international legitimacy to the Irish Republic, already backed by Germany, and open up the potential can of worms of it being recognised as a member of the Central Powers. As a solution, a new auxiliary was created for the RIC made up of former British soldiers; these became known as the **“Black and Tans”**.

The Irish received immediate support from the **German Empire**, though it would not be until 1919 that sufficient materiel arrived to have a major effect on the course of the war. The war was not conventional, but a **guerrilla conflict** with many small engagements. The Irish created an entire parallel court system in the territories under their control, undermining the legitimacy of the British government while preventing their own fighters from facing prosecution (since this from the British point of view, it was not considered a real war, and the IRA could not be treated as enemy combatants). In December of 1919 new elections were held with all but six counties in Ulster abstaining. These counties elected mostly unionists to Westminster, and the following year a second Irish parliament was created in the north, signalling the beginning of **Northern Ireland** as a separate unit.

By mid-1920, the tide of the war was shifting. The Black and Tans, due in part to the ambiguous legality of their position, had committed a large number of atrocities, and word of these had spread to the British press. The British public, still reeling from the end of the Weltkrieg, was becoming increasingly weary of the conflict. By 1921, with Britain facing post-war bankruptcy and the situation in Ireland increasingly out of their control as German shipments had left the Irish with no shortage of arms, Westminster sought a truce with the rebels and the Irish agreed on July 11th.

Minister for Finance, and mastermind behind the IRA campaign, **Michael Collins** and party founder Arthur Griffith were sent to negotiate the terms of peace, Eamon de Valera being still imprisoned. The **Anglo-Irish Treaty** was signed on November 10th, 1921, ending the war. Its terms saw the total withdrawal of British forces from Ireland. The Irish state was recognised as a **republic**, but would remain in **external association with Britain**, though not a member of the Commonwealth. In addition, the six counties of Northern Ireland were to be retained by Britain, and the Royal Navy was to have control of a number of strategic ports.

The treaty was generally considered a success and welcomed by the Irish populace. However, it proved divisive within Sinn Féin and especially the IRA, where many refused to accept partition. Dissenters split off to form the **Anti-Treaty Sinn Féin**, a big-tent coalition which practised abstentionism from the Dáil on the grounds that the treaty-based government was illegitimate. At the beginning of 1922, Griffith called a convention to draft a constitution for the Republic; despite political opposition, the Irish people approved it by referendum in February. It established the government as a semi-presidential parliamentary republic, with an elected president and the Príomh Aire (equivalent to Prime Minister) sharing executive powers.

In May, Griffith called a snap election before stepping down as president. **Eoin MacNeill** became Sinn Féin’s new leader, though promising to retain Michael Collins as head of government. Opposition to Collins within Sinn Féin had grown with his critics suspecting that he would become the real power behind MacNeill as they believed he had been behind Griffith. The anti-Collins faction, led by **Cathal Brugha** and including Eamon de Valera, left Sinn Féin and created the new party **Cumann an tSaorstáit**, which was socially conservative and staunchly republican. Brugha became the main opposing candidate for president, but the election saw Sinn Féin under MacNeill and Collins win handily. The MacNeill administration was preoccupied by the situation in Northern Ireland where sectarian violence continued to flare up. His government met with the Unionist leadership in Belfast promising to work towards a peaceful resolution, though other elements within Sinn Féin clandestinely supported the Ulster IRA.

In late 1924, the effects of the nationwide strike actions and mounting violence in Britain was being felt across the Irish Sea. Though the Irish unions at first moved to strike in solidarity with the British workers, **William O’Brien**, principal leader of trade unionism in Ireland and a staunch moderate, was successful in keeping the largest unions from striking during the British Revolution. Though the more militant unions did strike, their actions were small and disorganised and easily put down by the government. Anti-Treaty Sinn Féin was also affected, as a **break** finally came between the far-left and far-right wings of the movement.

The greatest difficulty, however, came with the status of Northern Ireland. Some within the Republic advocated invasion and annexation. The Unionist government in the north had unequivocally stood by the British monarchy and parliament, but when the government fled to Canada, communications became infrequent and the British government-in-exile ordered Belfast to simply hold tight. Though the Ulster Volunteers successfully maintained order, there were growing fears the syndicalists might invade once they had consolidated control of Britain. Collins proposed meetings with the Unionists on the possibility of **incorporation into the republic**, a move that was met with extreme reluctance in Belfast and outright anger among many in Ireland. Nonetheless, early in 1926 rumours that a red army was gathering in Liverpool for an invasion of Northern Ireland finally pushed the Unionists to agree to integration.

In exchange for “reunification” with Ireland, the Unionists received guarantees that the Irish would provide for their defence and honour a set of protections known as the **“Ulster Privileges”**. Significantly, these privileges granted the county councils of the six counties special autonomy, guaranteed that a certain number of Unionists would sit on the President’s Council of State, forbade altering the electoral boundaries within any of the six counties, and created a Minister for Ulster Affairs. Despite the concessions, integration was slow and faced much resistance from the Unionists. The reunification of Ireland should have been a great achievement for Sinn Féin; however, the Irish economy was in freefall following the collapse of Britain and the beginning of the Great Depression. The combination of economic woes, controversy surrounding the reunification process, and perception that MacNeill was a weak leader was enough to put Cumann an tSaorstáit over the top in the 1926 elections, and Cathal Brugha became president.

Brugha’s main policy in trying to achieve economic recovery was to pivot Ireland away from the Anglo-American market towards Germany. Irish agricultural products sold well in the German market and in return large-scale German investment began to enter Ireland. Ireland did not, however, join the Mitteleuropa bloc, as many members of Cumann an tSaorstáit including Prime Minister **de Valera** wanted to pursue economic self-sufficiency. As economic stagnation continued, however, leftist sentiment grew with the most radical groups beginning to receive clandestine support from Britain. The government banned syndicalist parties, and the labour movement fractured between reformists and revolutionaries, yet even underground the radicals continued to gain in strength.

With economic recovery sluggish and continuing controversy surrounding the Ulster Privileges, no party was able to win a majority during elections called in 1929 by Brugha. After negotiations, Sinn Féin entered a **confidence-and-supply agreement** with the **Ulster Democratic Party**, the successor to the Ulster Unionist Party, forming a new government including Collins himself as president with Richard Mulcahy as his Prime Minister. Unlike his predecessors, Collins whole-heartedly embraced trade with Germany, opening up Ireland to investment and paving the way for its entrance into the **Mitteleuropa** bloc. Collins believed that Ireland should move away from the Westminster system to a more American-style government with a strong president. In a series of closely-run referenda, measures to greatly **expand the presidency’s power** were approved. With his expanded powers, Collins **cracked down harshly** on the far-left and far-right even while Sinn Féin itself became more socially liberal.

In May of 1931, Eoin O’Duffy was removed as chief commissioner of the Garda (the Irish national police) by Collins due to his increasingly anti-Collins stance. **O’Duffy left Sinn Féin** and took with him many of the more right-wing and anti-German members. This faction joined with the remnants of the right-wing Anti-Treaty Sinn Féin to form **Aontas Náisiúnta**, a far-right party that espoused corporatism and opposed the Ulster Privileges. Meanwhile, Cumann an tSaorstáit, smarting from its electoral defeat, passed into the leadership of de Valera, who reorganised it as **An Saorstát Críostúil**, a thoroughly conservative party. The election of 1933 saw these new parties and several others attempt to chip away at Sinn Féin and the UDP’s dominance. They were partially successful: Sinn Féin achieved a plurality of only 46% in the Dáil and thus once again could not govern alone, forcing the party to continue their confidence-and-supply agreement. Though this alliance made Sinn Féin more beholden to the special interests of the north, Collins maintained his ascendancy, as the strong economy and recession of unrest cemented his popularity.

###Starting Situation

To start us off with 1936, here is Ireland’s [starting screen](https://i.imgur.com/iC4obPc.png), complete with a new, more age-appropriate portrait for Michael Collins.

At game start, Ireland is led by Sinn Féin, supported in confidence-and-supply by the Ulster Democratic Party, with Michael Collins serving his second consecutive term as president. The starting national spirits demonstrate Ireland's commitment to defending its independence, the consequences of the uneasy alliance between the UDP and the rest of the Republic, and the political effects of the nebulous and ill-defined additional allowances afforded to the loyalists. Also shown is the role played by the Catholic Church in Irish society, the dominance of Germany’s influence on the Irish economy in the last few years, and finally, the national spirit that comes with being part of Mitteleuropa.

***

###Black Monday

The next elections are a full year away, and things start out looking [optimistic](https://i.imgur.com/gqYF9Pk.png) for Sinn Féin, until it all comes crashing down in February. Ireland is one of the countries most affected by Black Monday, and its [consequences are catastrophic](https://i.imgur.com/F9NLMQO.png). Shortly after the apparent collapse of Ireland’s economic model, the cracks begin to show in Sinn Féin’s deal with the UDP, and Collins is faced with an ultimatum. Basil Brooke, the leader of the UDP, [demands that Collins prioritise the recovery of the north-east](https://i.imgur.com/Dv9bT44.png), while the rest of the country expects these efforts to be distributed evenly.

In the **“Ulster Comes First”** minigame, [Collins has six months](https://i.imgur.com/lN2iY4C.png) to somehow manage the impossible by attempting to satisfy both the UDP, as well as the country at large. This is completed through a [national focus branch](https://i.imgur.com/yXr87NW.png), as well as [unlockable decisions](https://i.imgur.com/pmwtI9f.png), all the while the full effects of the crisis are revealed over [successive weeks](https://i.imgur.com/LTGo7Yf.png), as the [various political factions](https://i.imgur.com/zQP4gQm.png) in Ireland are introduced to the player. Should Collins manage to appease one of the two groups fully, his chances of re-election are reasonable, and if he somehow manages both, almost guaranteed. However, each of the two groups must be [fully placated](https://i.imgur.com/ke3XbTk.png) for it to be seen by them as a success, as if he balances both groups without fully meeting the demands of either, the outcome will be [disastrous for his party’s electoral prospects](https://i.imgur.com/GFG4dKy.png).

###The LÉ Macha Incident

After the immediate fallout of Black Monday diminishes, the next, far greater challenge to the government suddenly emerges. In August 1936, an Irish ship, the **LÉ Macha**, is accidentally struck by the British submarine, the RNS Thetis. Despite the full recovery of all crew, the consequences of this collision are momentous, as it had taken place deep within **Irish territorial waters**. This quickly gathers the attention of the German Empire, who denounce it accordingly, and for the three parties involved, Ireland’s **isolated and vulnerable geopolitical position** is made all the more apparent.

The [LÉ Macha incident](https://i.imgur.com/Jy3P90L.png) marks the beginning of what could be considered the centrepiece of the rework, the [**“Gateway to the Atlantic”**](https://i.imgur.com/JgVrGAA.png) mechanic, a **diplomatic tug-of-war** between the German Empire and the Union of Britain, with Ireland in the middle. For over 18 months, Ireland will attempt to balance the influence of the Germans and the British, with both of which attempting to prevent the other from gaining undue control over Ireland’s political, economic and military institutions. From Ireland’s perspective, the **benefits** of foreign support for a small, underdeveloped country can be immense, but they will have to be sure to manage this foreign influence carefully, lest they **fly too close to the sun**.

The mechanic is based around German and British influence, which can be raised or lowered by Ireland by varied means. Germany and Britain themselves can raise their own influence with Ireland through decisions, paying via [short-acting debuffs](https://i.imgur.com/McuudPS.png). Ireland, however, pays for its decisions using political power, but can also alter the values through events and national foci. The LÉ Macha Incident unlocks a [national focus branch](https://i.imgur.com/HoBlhSp.png), where potential bonuses are available throughout the duration of the contest. The amount of influence from each side, either [above a certain threshold](https://i.imgur.com/HVuRrM6.png), or having [one greater than another](https://i.imgur.com/ksL0GkG.png) by a certain amount, for example, unlocks increasingly [powerful national foci](https://i.imgur.com/dHFmy1S.png) for Ireland, at the risk of favouring one side too heavily over another. How the contest ends is another matter, which we will come back to in time.

###1937 Elections

Of course, that is not all Collins has to worry about, as despite the Sinn Féin government taking a harder approach against possible causes of subversion over the past few years, Ireland remains a **democracy**, and the 1937 elections are to go ahead as scheduled. The **election campaigns** begin in earnest in November 1936, in the form of a series of [parliamentary debates](https://i.imgur.com/szWUB1m.png) being conducted in Dáil Éireann, as well as [decisions and missions](https://i.imgur.com/rePiXcU.png) that represent electioneering by the political parties. For the election, the player adopts the role of the ruling Sinn Féin government, but of the six other parties participating throughout the whole country, An Saorstát Críostúil and the Labour Party are seen as the alternate candidates to lead the next government.

Depending on how the “Ulster Comes First” minigame transpired, Collins may find himself under pressure from his party colleagues, should his potential bungling of the immediate aftermath of Black Monday come into question. At this point, the player may choose to have [Collins stand down](https://i.imgur.com/gdBYbw1.png) in favour of his Príomh Aire, or Prime Minister, **Richard Mulcahy**, who will instead [lead Ireland](https://i.imgur.com/j0ZRK0H.png) should Sinn Féin be victorious. In any case, the Big Fellow may still prove his detractors wrong, and win the election regardless of prior events.

The possible victors in the election are Sinn Féin, An Saorstát Críostúil, and the Labour Party, and after the ballots are counted, the political national foci are unlocked. Should [Sinn Féin](https://i.imgur.com/3ICHhwt.png) retain power, they will continue their confidence-and-supply with the UDP, and maintain their ecumenical, pro-industrialisation and anti-radical policies. While both party leaders share views on most matters, Collins and Mulcahy also have **unique sub-branches**, showcasing their differing approaches to others.

The next potential party to lead the government are **Éamon de Valera’s** [An Saorstát Críostúil](https://i.imgur.com/hkBmHKU.png), or the Christian Republic. De Valera sees himself as overdue a term in office, as he was leader of Sinn Féin during the War of Independence, prior to his capture by British forces. He left the party shortly after independence over disagreement in its direction and leadership, and considers Collins his personal rival. His party’s policies would be **socially conservative**, to the right of Sinn Féin socially but to their left economically, with heavy influence taken from the forms of welfare promoted by the Catholic social teaching.

But despite potentially winning the election, SC will not have the numbers to govern alone, and need to form a coalition. By far the most likely candidates for de Valera to work with are the pro-business **National Development Party**, led by former Sinn Féin member **Seán Lemass**, having left Sinn Féin following the introduction of some of the recent restrictions. Lemass and his followers formed a new party after joining forces with those representing the interests of the wealthy, particularly Anglo-Irish, business owners, but Lemass’ own revolutionary credentials put no doubt in the republicanism at its core. De Valera will need to [negotiate the terms](https://i.imgur.com/VoS0dBV.png) of the coalition with Lemass if it is to be successful, which usually will go favourably, but should a few too many concessions be made, more nationalist and conservative forces within in the country may find it too hard to come to terms with... more on that another time.

However, and only if Collins completely failed the “Ulster Comes First” minigame by satisfying the demands of neither the UDP or the country in general, the far-right, nationalist and corporatist party **Aontas Náisiúnta**, or National Union, [emerge as an alternate sidekick to SC](https://i.imgur.com/p1pWl6L.png). In other circumstances, the party’s anti-democratic tendencies and paramilitary connections prove too much for de Valera to consider working with them, but if Collins handled the immediate aftermath of Black Monday disastrously, then AN’s subsequent rise in prominence means **that all bets are off**. Ejected from Sinn Féin for anti-Protestant discrimination, Aontas Náisiúnta’s leader **Eoin O’Duffy** can serve as Príomh Aire to de Valera, bringing along the more parliamentarian wing of his party with him, adding their nationalist and corporatist policies to SC’s own moderate protectionism. SC have their own [sub-branch](https://i.imgur.com/dGC4UZR.png) in the political national focus branch, with some common foci, and other foci dependent on their coalition partner.

Given the emphasis placed by AN on minimising foreign influence in Ireland, any government that contains AN will have an [alternate sub-branch](https://i.imgur.com/5d0Eg4S.png) available in the **Gateway to the Atlantic** national foci. Rather than looking to exploit the benefits of foreign attention in Ireland, AN-containing governments can look inwards, and unlock [decisions](https://i.imgur.com/MgzTxHE.png) that **decrease foreign influence**, which can be used to unlock national foci that are only available when influence is under certain thresholds, for example. AN will be able to come to power in other ways, but there will be more on that later.

The third, and least likely party to lead the next government after the elections are the [Labour Party](https://i.imgur.com/6ACdi0i.png). Always the third wheel in Irish politics, Labour have evaded allegations of syndicalism through their careful management by long-term leader, **William O’Brien**. O’Brien, a consummate moderate, previously ejected party members under suspicion of syndicalist links, an action causing several younger, more radical members to leave the party out of protest, forming the **Progressive Labour Party**. Given that Labour is primarily associated with urban workers, in a heavily rurally-dominated country, if he is to somehow form a government, O’Brien is certain to [ally](https://i.imgur.com/T10DSGV.png) with the agrarian populist **Clann na Talmhan**, or “Family of the Land”. CnaT are a minor party, focusing on the issues of small farmers, and advocate for policies which benefit the rural working class as Labour does the urban. To make up numbers, any Labour-led administration will include CnaT as coalition partners, but their help alone will not be enough to form a government, and further [partners will be required](https://i.imgur.com/vRTfTV0.png).

Labour’s far most likely choice for a third party is the **National Development Party**, with such an alliance forming a “rainbow coalition” of sorts, to take Ireland out of the era of Sinn Féin through a series of compromised, modernising reforms. Such a move would do much to dampen the fears of Labour implementing overly-socialist policies, as the more capital-aligned NDP would be seen to subdue the already moderate social democratic party.

The other, less conventional option would be for Labour to go against the odds and form a broad left-wing coalition, by burying the hatchet with the pacifist, idealistic **Progressive Labour Party**. Labour’s avowed anti-syndicalist outlook could potentially steer this unwieldy combination of parties through the minefield that is the conservative establishment, towards the goal of true reform and potentially the gradual attainment of democratic socialism. However, if the PLP’s initial proposals are [heeded without moderation](https://i.imgur.com/4YQuKn7.png), then this dream is dead in the water, as conservative powers within the country find the policies far too radical, to predictable consequences to the new left-wing government... but, as you guessed it, more on that later. And as with SC, the Labour Party has its own [unique sub-branch](https://i.imgur.com/OsUCoKv.png) on the political national focus branch, with some foci dependent on coalition members present.

***

###The March on Dublin

The outcome of the 1937 election has the potential for **six different democratic governments**, as outlined above. But things can rarely be so simple. If SC are elected and make too many allowances towards elements within the NDP, or Labour are elected and adopt unaltered, radical policies proposed by the PLP, then the elected government will [not have a long term in office](https://i.imgur.com/wIShDq3.png).

Aontas Náisiúnta are a party born out of different splits from Sinn Féin. The first came in opposition to the **Anglo-Irish Treaty**, refusing to accept the realities of partition and external association with Britain at the time, and later Eoin O’Duffy’s objection to the **Ulster Privileges**, the controversial accords between the UDP and the Irish government, maintaining Northern Ireland as part of the republic at the expense of the rights of northern Catholics. The party is anything but homogenous, with **several factions** of varying beliefs existing internally. However, after their paramilitary group the National Guard, better known as the **Blueshirts**, overthrow the unpopular, unstable elected government in a bloodless coup, it will be then [Eoin O’Duffy](https://i.imgur.com/qVWpehM.png) who leads Ireland, with the radical extremist **Gearóid Ó Cuinneagáin** as his Príomh Aire.

This new regime’s first aims will involve **crippling any dissent** to their rule, for which they have another political [sub-branch](https://i.imgur.com/7QOyTx1.png), but much like their democratic counterparts, will simultaneously have to deal with the Gateway to the Atlantic mechanic, using the sub-branch that is also available to the party when participating in elected government with SC. The party will also have to deal with its own **internal conflict**, but this will be covered in the second Progress Report...

***

###The Ulster Crisis

After the election and its following events, the new government, will find itself under pressure by the electorate to fully [resolve the effects of Black Monday](https://i.imgur.com/pQmzNZS.png) within a [reasonable timeframe](https://i.imgur.com/XQtoQzw.png), which is managed through **unique ways** by each party through their political national foci. However, they will have a difficult time managing this, as more disquiet looms on the horizon.

This comes in the form of [worsening tensions](https://i.imgur.com/RjCgIFr.png) in Northern Ireland, as Black Monday has laid bare the open **discrimination of Catholics** in areas controlled by loyalist-dominated county councils. These Catholics begin to demand fair treatment by their neighbours, leading to increasing levels of ethno-religious conflict in the region, eventually breaking out in civil unrest and open rioting.

As these protests increase in intensity, the Dublin government looks ill-prepared to handle them should they escalate further. The Irish Republican Army, known for some **Germanophilic tendencies** but generally staying out of the political sphere, [note these developments carefully](https://i.imgur.com/nQKck0W.png), and more politically-minded officers contemplate stepping in to prevent the government and state collapsing entirely during the unrest.

The exact way these events will play out will depend on the incumbent government in question, but the final outcome of the Ulster Crisis will be determined by how the Gateway to the Atlantic mechanic has proceeded. Noting the growing instability in the Irish government, both Germany and Britain [are made aware](https://i.imgur.com/kPWYK2G.png) that events are coming to a head, and that soon the **winner of this mechanic** will be decided.

***

###The Dust Clears

When the mechanic ends, if either Germany or Britain has **15 or more influence points** more than the other, they will be made the victor of the Gateway to the Atlantic mechanic. If neither side has 15 more than the other, then **Ireland has managed to navigate the crisis** unscathed.

Should Germany be victorious, the IRA successfully overthrow the unstable government, using German assistance to dampen down unrest before it intensifies further. Ireland is then made a **puppet of the German Empire**, and Germany [instates a new government](https://i.imgur.com/aF9AC8Y.png). This is chosen by Germany, and can be led by potentially **any of the four main parties**, depending on the government that is being replaced. Ireland will become a puppet, though eventually, should they prove themselves in their political, economic and military endeavours, can become an **independent member of the Reichspakt**. The political foci of the German-puppet outcomes are shared with their respective non-puppet outcomes, but with a [few variant foci](https://i.imgur.com/KvsU8hl.png) available involving Ireland making the most of its new relationship, and later seeking [full independence](https://i.imgur.com/MWlOs3y.png).

If Britain wins the mechanic, then the army still launches its coup of the incumbent government, but to wildly differing consequences. The military is itself then overthrown by a **socialist uprising**, orchestrated with considerable assistance from the Union of Britain, and an [Irish socialist government is installed](https://i.imgur.com/HOHJOmX.png). Due to its existence being entirely dependent on foreign aid and with little initial public support, this government starts as a **puppet of the Union of Britain**, but similar to the German-victory outcome, if it proves its legitimacy to the people, can later become an **independent member of the Third Internationale**. The exact nature of this regime depends on what government is overthrown, and some other factors, but there will be more on this in the second Progress Report.

Finally, if Ireland manages to **balance German and British influences**, then the [government stays in power](https://i.imgur.com/SSY24U6.png), and Ireland remains independent. Due to Germany and Britain both succeeding in their main objective, which was to prevent Ireland falling into the others’ hands, both receive a bonus of political power as a return of investment, dependent on the number of times they pressured Ireland during the mechanic. Ireland’s regime is now **secure for the foreseeable future**, and will be free to follow its own foreign policy, with faction joining unlocked, and with the country most likely remaining neutral, but also potentially joining the [Reichspakt or Entente](https://i.imgur.com/zxyaSkl.png). The AI’s choice will be weighted accordingly, according to their ruling party, but the player will be free to choose whichever option they wish.

For the democratic governments, the peaceful resolution of the Ulster Crisis acts as a **wake-up call** to both loyalists and nationalists. Both can see the fragile nature of their political independence, and agree that a new settlement is crucial for their continued survival. This unlocks a [further small sub-branch](https://i.imgur.com/iu8ybmT.png) to the political national foci, beginning an event chain where a new **Constitution** can be written, to better negotiate a more long-term solution for peace on the island. This can eventually remove the deleterious effects of the Ulster Privileges, but there will be further details on this in the second Progress Report.

Gov pass 3rd reading to lower food standards - Full list of MPs who voted to lower our food standards during the Covid pandemic,1275,ukpolitics,https://www.reddit.com/r/ukpolitics/comments/gxs6qz/gov_pass_3rd_reading_to_lower_food_standards_full/,1591454516.0,"https://www.thelondoneconomic.com/news/full-list-of-mps-who-voted-to-lower-our-food-standards-during-the-covid-pandemic/26/05/

>Under cover of the Coronavirus pandemic and headlines over the Government’s handling of the crisis which has seen Britain suffer more deaths than any other European country, another major public health story has slipped through barely noticed, and has rarely been mentioned in the weekly PMQs.

>The most important farming legislation in generations passed its third reading in parliament despite warnings that in a bid to make the UK market pliable for a post-Brexit US trade deal, protections of minimum food safety standards have evaporated, as have safeguards for Britain’s farmers.

>With most MPs still socially distanced at home, MPs passed the legislation’s third reading in a virtual vote – 360 – 211 despite guarantees of a minimum standard to protect British food – and therefor British farming – being absent from the overhaul of UK agriculture. A full list of how they voted in this crucial legislation is below.

>As the bill moves to the Lords for a second reading amid outrage from UK farmers, this weekend former Ulster Unionist MEP Jim Nicholson expressed his disbelief that all eight DUP MPs had voted with Conservative colleagues for a bill he said has “the potential to be the last nail in the coffin for agriculture in Northern Ireland.”

>He warned: “the Bill opens the flood gates to cheap food imports into the UK from around the world. This food will not have been produced to the same standards achieved consistently by farmers in Northern Ireland. These imports will serve to drive markets down at a time when local farmers are under tremendous pressure.”

>It was sadly predictable to see Conservative and DUP MPs falling into line, despite previous concerns expressed by those very MPs that have rural constituencies or knowledge of foods and farming, or indeed Northern Ireland – where the farming industry now has big concerns with Boris Johnson’s promises of no border checks and alignment with the rest of the UK rather than Europe evaporating daily.

>Just ONE Tory MP rebelled: Helen Grant, Conservative MP for Maidstone and the Weald. Not one Labour, Lib Dem or SNP MP voted for the bill.

>Leaving the EU means the UK is also leaving the common agricultural policy, which currently funds UK agriculture to the tune of £3.5bn a year. The Agriculture Bill provides the legislative framework for replacement agricultural support schemes. It is now heading to the House of Lords and on target to pass through parliament by the summer.

>Crucially, amendments to protect our food and farmers were defeated and left off the first Agriculture Bill in over 40 years.

>**Animal welfare fears**

>Farmers, environmentalists and consumer groups united to beg the Government to honour its manifesto pledge not to undermine food standards and the future of British farming with low-quality imports in post-Brexit trade deals. They warned that without guidelines on food quality, Britain would be flooded by cheap produce from foreign countries where meats are allowed to be pumped full of drugs and animal welfare is much lower than EU standards. British farmers would not be able to compete in price and if they lowered standards too below EU standards, they would lose their main market in Europe and face a catastrophe either way.

>“Our trade policy must reflect our moral responsibilities to the planet and the people and creatures that live on it – protecting our natural environment, caring for our farmed animals, and working toward a more sustainable, climate-friendly way of farming and food production,” said the National Farming Union’s president Minette Batters. “We have the chance to become a global leader in climate-friendly farming, and neither farmers nor the public want to see that ambition fall by the wayside because our trade policy does not hold food imports to the same standards as are expected of our own farmers.”

>**Chlorinated chicken and hormone-filled beef**

>Environment Secretary George Eustice refused to rule out chlorinated chicken and hormone-treated beef being imported from the US in a post-Brexit trade deal and he voted against his own 2019 proposals to protect the UK’s high animal welfare and food hygiene standards by banning the sale of lower standard foods such as chlorine-washed chicken and hormone-injected beef when it was again tabled as a Labour amendment to the Agriculture Bill.

>Labour’s shadow environment secretary Luke Pollard said the Tories are now “tying themselves in knots to get a damaging trade deal with Donald Trump whatever the cost. This government is in chaos.

>“Labour used the exact same text put forward by the Secretary of State when he was a backbencher, that would have protected our food standards. Now he and the Tories have voted it down.”
Conservative rebel amendment to protect food standards defeated

>Rebel Conservative and Labour amendments to hold the Government to previous promises to protect British food and farming were also defeated. Senior Conservatives Simon Hoare and Neil Parish led the push for the Agriculture Bill, which sets out new policy as the UK quits the EU-wide Common Agricultural Policy, to require a level playing field between British farmers and those overseas in future trade agreements.

>183 Labour MPs, 44 SNP MPs, 11 Liberal Democrats, 8 DUP as well as Green Party MP Caroline Lucas, voted in favour of the rebel amendment. Only 22 Conservatives voted for the defeated amendment, including Simon Hoare, Neil Parish and former Environment Secretary Theresa Villiers.

>The other rebels who voted for the amendment requiring new international treaties on the import of agricultural and food products to ensure products imported into the UK under those arrangements comply with World Trade Organisation safety rules and the UK’s own standards were: Bob Blackman, Claire Coutinho, Tracey Crouch, Roger Gale, John Hayes, Gordon Henderson, Neil Hudson, Simon Jupp, Pauline Latham, Ian Liddell-Grainger, Chris Loder, Jason McCartney, David Morris, Caroline Nokes, David Simmonds, Gary Streeter, Julian Sturdy, Rishi Sunak and David Warburton.

>A further 15 Tory MPs abstained, yet the amendment was defeated by 277 votes to 328, a majority of 51, although Deputy Speaker Dame Eleanor Laing said some MPs had mistakenly voted the wrong way via the new electronic system – but she added this would not have affected the result.

>Chancellor of the Exchequer Rishi Sunak later insisted he had been one of those to vote for the rebel amendment by mistake as did his Conservative colleague Pauline Latham.

Reform of Agriculture in Ireland,20,ireland,https://www.reddit.com/r/ireland/comments/gohbrl/reform_of_agriculture_in_ireland/,1590145508.0,"I work with farmers throughout the country, and spend a lot of time in rural areas. I've been thinking for a while now that our agricultural system is completely unbalanced, almost entirely focussed on beef and dairy, with arable only in the south east, and sheep in the uplands / bogs.

I know that Ireland's climate is particularly well suited to grass, so we've focussed on that, and the export market. However, we're massively over-producing milk, and beef prices are very low, unprofitable without subsidies. Much of our dairy products are exported to the UK, but there is considerable uncertainty about that market, considering that they're trying to deregulate their domestic market. Our livestock are also producing massive greenhouse gas emissions. 

I think we need to diversify our agriculture again, by producing what we need here in Ireland, and focussing less on imports and exports. There are plenty of things that we can't grow in Ireland, or that are out of season, so of course they should be imported. However, if it can be grown here, then we should grow it. 

By the same logic, we should reduce our livestock sector to what is required for domestic consumption, and rely less on exports. That would allow us to reduce the national herd, and increase milk / beef prices to a level that is profitable for farmers.

People will say that Irish conditions are too wet for most arable agriculture. However, the country once supported a much larger population, and produced enough food for everyone without relying on imports. That was also achieved without the machinery, drainage, fertilisers and pesticides that we use now. So there is no doubt that much of our pastureland could be converted to other forms of agriculture.","['Grow what , you just threw out well known facts but no suggestions on reform.

Whenever irish people are mentioned on the podcast, there's a potato-famine jab, but I actually don't know anything about it. I feel it has become this ""floating signifier"" whenever irish history/immigration to the US is mentioned, but I suspect that there is probably a pretty interesting story at heart there.

Why did it become this catastrophic situation that pushed people to flee the country? Why did the infrastructure of producing food get so focused on a monoculture type of potato? Why potato? Why was there no backup-plan in the form of planting other root-vegetables?

Is the irish potato-famine the first example of catastrophic ""specialization""/monoculture farming that highlighted how bad things can play out if you put all your faith in one particular type of crop?

What was irish farming like before the consolidation to this monoculture potato type? Was there a wider variety of crops, that demonstrably worked in the climate of Ireland?

.... it's not american history, but  it pops up enough that it could (at the very least) be a good topic for UK-dollop/non-US dollop.

There's also the ""somewhat equivalent"" situation in the US that (as I understand it) caused ""The Great Dust Bowl"" of 1930 ( monoculture planting, exhausting the nutrients in the ground by discarding old ways of farming in lieu of a new, industralized idea of how farming should work, etc).

There's plenty of overlap between the irish potato famine and the US dust bowl, and both situations seem very relevant to modern farming.","['Behind the Bastards just did it', 'The potato famine and the dust bowl are actually pretty different. They both led to mass migration, but had different causes. The potato famine was cause by blight killing the crops. Not just potatoes and not just in Ireland, but Ireland was hardest hit. It was catastrophic because of how the English government treated the Irish before and during the famine. In France was hit pretty hard  by the blight too, but the government helped it\'s people, so they didn\'t have a million people die or mass migration.\n\nLeading up to the dust bowl, speculators were buying up prairie land to grow wheat because WW1 made wheat so profitable. They didn\'t know what they were doing. Wheat prices crash after the war, but people think it will come back, so they keep planting. Meanwhile a multi year drought happens. All the prairie sod that held the soil together was plowed up for wheat. When the drought hits, the soil just starts blowing away. The government did different things to help the farmers and the land, some had more success than others. There was a plan to build a line of trees across the middle of the country to slow the wind. Trees were planted, but the project was stopped before anything too big was created. One thing that had real success was paying farmers to ""farm"" sod. The farmers tore out their crops and replanted sod. They got paid every year they kept the sod. It helped give the farmers income during the great depression, the sod held the soil in place, and helped protect the Ogallala Aquifer (for a little while anyway, the aquifer is in danger).\n\nThey are both fascinating subjects!

I've wanted to make this post for a while as there's a rapidly growing disconnect between consumers and where their food comes from. If you have any questions related to agriculture ask them here and I'll try my best to answer them from an informed point of view.

My father runs the farm and I help out in the evenings/weekend as I have a full time job. I've a degree in Agricultural Science from UCD and work as an animal nutritionist. I have a good knowledge of cattle, sheep, pig and tillage farming, so should be able to answer most questions.

&#x200B;

Answers will just be my opinion or an expression of the general consensus held by farmers in Ireland. Like everything, there are a handful of farmers who practice very poorly and give us all a bad name, and they seem to get much more attention than the majority of us who work within the rules and actively do our best to make a positive difference, so please don't look at us all in the same light.

&#x200B;

The only thing I ask is that comments are respectful and non-abusive. There's a large portion of this subreddit who are extremely anti-agriculture and I ask that if you have no genuine questions or nothing good to say then please don't comment as I want this to be a positive, open discussion where we can all learn a bit. I'll not be replying to comments that don't comply with this.

###The Direction of the National Union

As we talked about last Friday, the hardline nationalist party Aontas Náisiúnta, or National Union, can potentially [overthrow](https://i.imgur.com/wIShDq3.png) newly-inaugurated An Saorstát Críostúil or Labour Party governments, should the latter two parties make some particularly **grave errors** while negotiating the terms of the government with their would-be coalition partners. The unpopular actions of these parties can result in AN’s associated paramilitary group, the **Blueshirts**, ousting the elected government in a bloodless coup known as the March on Dublin, with the Irish police and army tacitly supporting such a move due to similar concerns. AN leader **Eoin O’Duffy** is made president, and chooses the young radical **Gearóid Ó Cuinneagáin** as his Príomh Aire, or Prime Minister.

The political movement that is AN comes from two major sources. Firstly, after the Anglo-Irish Treaty, Sinn Féin split into Pro- and Anti-Treaty groupings, with the Pro-Treaty cohort being by far the larger faction. **Anti-Treaty Sinn Féin** was a big-tent offshoot, consisting of **right- and left-wing components** that shared little else but opposition to the terms of the treaty. On the right wing of these was **John J. O’Kelly**, a conservative Gaelic revivalist, who could not accept several of the concessions that had been made. Secondly, Eoin O’Duffy, a former personal ally of Michael Collins and noted veteran of the War of Independence, was later ejected from Sinn Féin following the controversy during his tenure as Garda (police) commissioner, where he was accused of anti-Protestant discrimination. Together with their associated followers, O’Duffy and O’Kelly formed **Aontas Náisiúnta** in 1931. As well as the Ulster Privileges, they are opposed to any undue foreign interference in Ireland, and are rabidly anti-syndicalist. Leading up to the coup, the party consists of a **Parliamentarian** faction, led by O’Duffy, who are willing to take their seats in Dáil Éireann, and a more radical **Abstentionist** faction, who do not attend Leinster House after being elected, and refuse to recognise the legitimacy of the Dáil. 

O’Duffy’s ideal regime would be a **militarised, corporatist dictatorship**, led by himself ruling by decree, with all forms of foreign, corrupting deviance stamped out. The Ulster Privileges would be torn up, and all non-Catholics would find it very difficult to participate in public life, if not face outright discrimination. The Parliamentarians recognise the Republic for what it is, but their **disdain for democracy** does not prevent them, prior to the coup at least, from participating in Dáil Éireann. They can potentially join An Saorstát Críostúil in coalition through this manner, as outlined previously.

The Abstentionists are a minority within the party, but hold disproportionate influence among the Blueshirts, the party’s paramilitary group. Their leader is the young former civil servant Gearóid Ó Cuinneagáin, a true ideologue and aspiring autocrat who takes inspiration from **integralist** movements found on the continent, and through them, the teachings of Charles Maurras. Elevating the party’s already nationalistic doctrines to another level, Ó Cuinneagáin aspires towards an Ireland that undoes the harm caused by the English language, particularly over the last 90 years since the Great Famine, and wishes to bring the country back to a time when the **Irish language and Gaelic culture**, reigned supreme on the island. If one was to describe O’Duffy’s faction as being **Catholic nationalists**, then Ó Cuinneagáin’s faction could be described as **Gaelic nationalists**, with less concern about the religious affiliations of the Anglo-Irish and Ulster Scots, so long as they prove themselves to be culturally Irish. Ó Cuinnegáin’s rising prominence within the movement, particularly after the March on Dublin, is reason for O’Duffy’s attempted placating of him by giving him the responsibility of the role of Príomh Aire, but this may yet **backfire** for the party leader.

If AN come to power, then the former Parliamentarian and Abstentionist labels lose their meaning, as both factions openly participate in the regime. Their innate differences remain however, and they are then recognised as the **Old Guard** and **New Guard**, respectively. Their change of circumstances cause the divisions in the party to [come to the fore for the first time](https://i.imgur.com/5wZbSNV.png), as while the new regime establishes itself after the coup, a Balance of Power, the [Direction of the National Union](https://i.imgur.com/YwLAGhg.png), begins between both main factions within the party.

O’Duffy’s government will still need to navigate the same challenges as the elected governments, namely the Gateway to the Atlantic mechanic, and the Civil Rights issues faced in Northern Ireland. Given the nature of their regime however, their approaches [can differ considerably](https://i.imgur.com/PX8AWj7.png) from the democratic parties. The events outlining the party’s reaction to these crises can also result in a chance for the player to intervene in the Balance of Power, [shifting it further towards the Old or New Guard](https://i.imgur.com/gmsYKkU.png).

The end of the Gateway of the Atlantic mechanic in March 1938 also marks the end of the power struggle within the party. Should Germany or Britain win, then the AN government will be overthrown and Ireland will become a puppet, similar to what occurs in the democratic paths. If Ireland remains independent, however, there are **three potential outcomes**.

If the Balance of Power is shifted sufficiently towards the Old Guard, then O’Duffy successfully **solidifies his rule**, working closely with the army to diminish the prominence of the dangerous radicals in the party. As he builds his regime to his liking, his next choice will be his [new second-in-command](https://i.imgur.com/HMo4lb0.png), given Ó Cuinneagáin’s fall from favour. Initially taking the role is the comparatively moderate conservative and party co-founder John J. O’Kelly, but O’Duffy can instead opt to emphasise his links with the Blueshirts, or the military, depending on who is appointed. Regardless of who aids him in his rule, O’Duffy’s regime will take the form of an [ultra-conservative, militarised dictatorship](https://i.imgur.com/chD4cpH.png), built upon the values of **faith and fatherland**.

Should the Balance of Power favour the New Guard, Ireland will be [**transformed forever**](https://i.imgur.com/YCczH7c.png). Ó Cuinneagáin gathers enough support in the regime, and completely undermines O’Duffy’s perceived suitability to leadership, wresting from him the control of the party, and indeed of Ireland itself. Following his ascension, he then immediately undergoes a [brutal purge](https://i.imgur.com/WuJHFzu.png) against all in the party and army that oppose his aims. At the heart of his next choice will be the unspeakable act of [questioning the core tenet](https://i.imgur.com/VIYUTer.png) that is Irish republicanism. In order to truly **bring Ireland back** to its golden age as he sees it, before the arrival of the foreign invader, he will seek to return Ireland to the society that existed when the Gaelic way of life flourished without disturbance, a time before imported ideologies like republicanism, a time when Ireland was **monarchical**. A scion of the ancient O’Neill dynasty exists in Portugal, his forebears having fled there after a failed rebellion against the English, and the young Jorge Maria O’Neill may be crowned as [King Aodh Ó Néill of Ireland](https://i.imgur.com/h1UxZMV.png). Alternatively, Ó Cuinneagáin’s personal **autocratic tendencies** can prove too much to resist, and he declares the [Regency of Ireland](https://i.imgur.com/QcPqwNI.png), where he will rule as Ceannaire, or Leader, until such time as a Gaelic King worthy of the throne of Ireland should make themselves known. Ó Cuinneagáin’s faction of the party [have numerous radical aims](https://i.imgur.com/6VvXyQl.png), and will also seek to completely de-anglicise the island, with the intention being the eventual removal of the English language over a number of years, but it begins by returning many Irish surnames to their [original Irish language forms](https://i.imgur.com/t4cCDCq.png).

Finally, if the Balance of Power remains in the middle, the internal conflict proves too much, and though Ireland’s independence is maintained, O’Duffy’s regime **collapses from within**. Left to pick up the pieces is party co-founder, [John J. O’Kelly](https://i.imgur.com/hwC7pfm.png), who in the interest of stability, makes a deal with An Saorstát Críostúil leader Éamon de Valera, where both parties form a coalition and return Ireland to a **semblance of democracy**. From this point onwards, Ireland proceeds similarly to how it would have if the SC-AN coalition had been elected in the first place, but with O’Kelly serving as President and de Valera as his Príomh Aire. O’Kelly’s government, like other parliamentary regimes, will write a new constitution, doing so changing his government’s ideology from Paternal Autocrat to Authoritarian Democrat.

Of course, Aontas Náisiúnta’s approach towards the growing ethno-religious tensions that make up the Ulster Crisis would be a bit more, shall we say, **heavy-handed** than their democratic counterparts, and because of this, will be handled differently in-game. If either the Old Guard or New Guard are successful in the Balance of Power, then a [new decision category will emerge](https://i.imgur.com/tMwphph.png), with timed missions appearing representing the growing **outrage of the loyalists** in Ulster. From this point onwards, if the AN regime does not manage this successfully, they will be facing an **armed uprising** from the UDP, and find themselves at [war with Northern Ireland](https://i.imgur.com/3JFVrxO.png) as it spawns on the map. Northern Ireland itself will remain unplayable, but will be complete with its own focus tree and potential outcomes should they succeed, which we will discuss at a later time. To cap it all off, here is the [complete focus sub-branch](https://i.imgur.com/Rdfp9dJ.png) of the politics foci for AN.

***

###Connolly’s Legacy

From the far-right to the far-left, we will now change course entirely, and take a look at what happens if the Union of Britain is the victor in the Gateway to the Atlantic mechanic. But first, I think it would be helpful to give us some context to our design process.

Early in the development of this rework, we came to the conclusion that left-wing politics was of far too low popularity in Ireland in this era to come to power in 1936 through any democratic means, or even through mass industrial action or the like. There have been many famous Irish socialist leaders and agitators, but the ideology as a whole had very little popular electoral support historically. And, despite this being a world where socialism is far more prominent in western Europe, mainstream Ireland’s suspicion of the ideology would only be heightened due to its association with Britain, their historical oppressor. However, we always knew we wanted to include socialist content for Ireland, and so for this to be any way possible and plausible, we knew that some outside aid was going to be needed. And accordingly, if Ireland’s socialists needed outside support to take over, Britain would be the obvious choice for a benefactor, but if Britain would be attempting to manipulate Ireland, surely Germany would look to counter this, to curb the spread of syndicalist influence. Out of these thoughts, the Gateway to the Atlantic was born.

Coming back to in-game terms, after Britain aids a successful [Second Irish Revolution](https://i.imgur.com/jGzekp3.png), in most cases, the **militant, agrarian, and heavily nationalist** [Saor Éire seize power](https://i.imgur.com/Abno3yY.png). Saor Éire, meaning Free Ireland, come originally from the left wing of Anti-Treaty Sinn Féin, despise the bourgeoisie Irish government as much as they did the old British establishment, and see the outcome of the War of Independence as the ultimate missed opportunity. They are associated with the **Irish Citizen Army** paramilitary group, famous for their involvement in the 1916 Rising, but the party’s support base comes from the poorest of rural workers. Their [political beliefs](https://i.imgur.com/zMVdxCN.png), deriving from extremist forms of Irish nationalism, and taking further influence from other far-left nationalist movements abroad, revolve around their proposed **Red Trinity**. This is where the culmination of the union, army and party merges with the state itself, and where every citizen participates in each, creating an all-encompassing party-state that holds supreme control over the lives of every citizen of the Republic. Their Red Trinity would replace any existing one, as while not quite being state atheists, SÉ would be by far the most **anti-clerical** party on the island, something which may prove to be their downfall in such a religiously-minded country. Though extremely **totalitarian**, the party would believe in the “cult of the nation” rather than centralisation of power onto any individual, and party chairman Peadar O’Donnell remains an articulate and impassioned figurehead, but a figurehead nonetheless.

As Ireland becomes socialist through armed insurrection, Saor Éire’s association with the Irish Citizen Army puts them in prime position to take control. However, if their approach proves **too extreme**, then Saor Éire’s limited support in the wake of the revolution [can fade away](https://i.imgur.com/SERzql7.png), and their regime collapses, as the Irish Syndicalist Party [steps in to take its place](https://i.imgur.com/GT1GbYR.png). The ISP is a far more **conventional syndicalist party**, and while they always believed in an independent Irish state, they are far less overtly nationalist than Saor Éire. They would be most aligned ideologically with the Orthodoxes in the Commune of France, and are led by the charismatic and imposing [Jim Larkin](https://i.imgur.com/ccyF52X.png), who was heavily involved in not only socialism, but syndicalism in particular, since before the Weltkrieg. Larkin’s party, being associated with industrial syndicalism, **would lack the support base** it would have in most other countries, given Ireland’s agriculturally-based economy. But, Larkin’s force of personality, the party’s association with the legacy of the hero of 1916, James Connolly, and their support from their allies, can make up for the party having less initial popularity than SÉ, and will go a long way towards [urbanising, industrialising and syndicalising](https://i.imgur.com/uEzoeCn.png) the country all at once.

Alternatively, in the rare occasion that Ireland is ruled by the **Labour-CnaT-PLP coalition** at the time of Britain’s victory in the Gateway to the Atlantic, the Second Irish Revolution can transpire quite differently. After the collapse of the elected government to the military coup, certain members of the PLP’s parliamentary party [rise to prominence](https://i.imgur.com/YxQeNne.png) in their appeals for a revolt against the new military junta. It emerges that, despite William O’Brien’s careful stewardship of the Labour Party against entryism from the further left, the young idealist Owen Sheehy-Skeffington did not take quite the same amount of care, as his party is awash with **syndicalist-aligned collaborators**. Only in these circumstances should this become apparent, and this wing of the party comes to power following the Second Irish Revolution, taking over both party and country. Ireland is left with a system which [retains many aspects](https://i.imgur.com/3CTjXk8.png) of the **old parliamentary government**, and will take a **more moderate** course than SÉ and the ISP. For O’Brien however, the outcome is one of **extreme irony**, as despite his previous defence against extremism, he is left in place as a [puppet President](https://i.imgur.com/JA1007m.png), holding little power and only acting as a face of the regime for his new British-aligned masters. He can attempt to [make the best](https://i.imgur.com/K7QvQh8.png) of the new situation, but from here on in, Ireland’s place is with the Third Internationale. With all three paths now discussed, here are the [combined socialist sub-branches](https://i.imgur.com/9QaL3w6.png).

Due to the large amount of foreign influence needed for any Second Irish Revolution to occur, and the relative lack of support for socialism in Ireland, each of these three administrations will suffer from a **lack of legitimacy** with the people, and will face [resistance all over the country](https://i.imgur.com/X3q0OXz.png) to their initial takeover. However, should the government first overcome this insurrection, and then [prove itself to the nation](https://i.imgur.com/qaPyh9T.png), it can eventually once more [throw off its shackles](https://i.imgur.com/qfndsM6.png), and **declare full independence** while becoming an equal full member of the Third Internationale in its own right. And finally, similar to the far-right, the socialists are going to find a considerable, but unsurprising, amount of [resistance from the loyalists](https://i.imgur.com/7O3dctM.png) in Northern Ireland, which if they fail to contain, will result in **Northern Ireland declaring war during the Weltkrieg**, once the Entente is at war with the Third Internationale. Given the opposition from within and without, [socialist Ireland](https://i.imgur.com/h3aOT8W.png) will be a challenging playthrough, but one that is rewarding if it can be pulled off.

And with each of the paths now discussed, I can now present to you the full [political focus branch](https://i.imgur.com/48yJdWg.png).

***

###The Republic Maintained

From the far-right, to the far-left, we **return to the centre**. As discussed last week, each of the six electable democratic governments in Ireland will remain in place should Ireland remain independent. Or, alternatively, one may be put in power by Germany following Berlin’s victory in the Gateway to the Atlantic. So what then? If Ireland remains independent, a [new constitution](https://i.imgur.com/dnegWtO.png) will be drawn up, many details of which can be decided by the player. Over the course of an **event chain**, the player can decide several articles that are core aspects of the Republic. In terms of the overall **form of the Republic**, the player can decide if it retains some form of special allowance for the north-eastern counties, adopts a fully unitary republic, implements a more defined form of devolution for the north-east, or even transforms the island into a federation. This is where Reluctant Countrymen, Northern Ireland’s [unique state modifier](https://i.imgur.com/uB5Q7SD.png) can be altered in the democratic paths, when the other paths have it changed in different ways over the course of a playthrough. The choice of the [form of the Republic](https://i.imgur.com/BHXcUV8.png) will affect the final modifier present on the National Spirit representing the Constitution itself, and this National Spirit will be altered further in different articles of the treaty.

Similar questions will be asked about what [electoral system](https://i.imgur.com/XDgpiDe.png) is to be used, the status of religion, the Irish language, and other such matters. Notably, the role of the President will be called into question. Given the increased power given Presidency during Collins’ earlier tenure, this will also be redefined in law. A fully Presidential system may be enacted, or more power may be given to the Príomh Aire, similar to how it was in 1923. Alternatively, a different course may be taken, where the role of the President is made into a more **ceremonial position**, and the true executive power lies in the Prime Minister, formerly called the Príomh Aire but now renamed into the role of **Taoiseach**, literally meaning Chieftain. Should this be chosen, a new President will [need to be appointed](https://i.imgur.com/sk40Rqh.png), of which there are [five options](https://i.imgur.com/omAzaS1.png). In the end, the Constitution will involve choices in terms of how a compromise may be formed with the loyalists, unlocking decisions to gradually **reduce Nationalist unrest and Loyalist anger**, and the eventual result will mean the **hope for a lasting end to conflict on the island**, and the true realisation of the ideals of the Irish tricolour - green, and orange, with peace between them.

I have mentioned before that in the Ireland rework, each of the ten ideologies in Kaiserreich will be playable. So how can the rest come to power? Well, either if independent or as part of a German-orientated democracy, for all democratic governments, the **1941 elections** will go ahead as planned. For this, I am pleased to show you the [post-1941](https://i.imgur.com/k1Z3Rd4.png) democratic political national focus branch. For each election from 1941 onwards, each of the **seven parties** that fully participate in parliamentary politics are electable, should they have been members of the government at the time of the election. The [National Development Party](https://i.imgur.com/Ki3sdMF.png), for instance, can be elected in 1941, had they been members of government alongside either SC or the Labour Party, as the **ruling coalition** is re-elected and the NDP becomes the senior party of government. Similarly, [Clann na Talmhan](https://i.imgur.com/ekel2lZ.png) can be elected if Labour had been in office, as CnaT would always also have been in the coalition.

You may note that the [Progressive Labour Party](https://i.imgur.com/sEWOMUF.png) can be elected democratically in some circumstances, and this is the case. However, due to the Britain’s influence failing to make inroads if Ireland remained democratic, the party is dominated by its **pacifist core**, and [will only be able to join the Third Internationale](https://i.imgur.com/CL0IoO6.png) should the German Empire be defeated, or indeed even be only electable in the first place if the Third Internationale still exists.

Due to their coalition and rule becoming more driven towards their specific vision in the second term, both SC and AN governments may decide to [act upon their isolationist rhetoric](https://i.imgur.com/7Ezg8XA.png) and **Leave Mitteleuropa** after the 1941 elections. This option is also available late in the tree for O’Duffy’s dictatorship, but each of three governments may or may not decide such a change of course, depending on their alignment and on Germany’s ruling administration.

And, similar to how the moderate wing of Aontas Náisiúnta can change their ideology from Paternal Autocrat from Authoritarian Democrat if John J. O’Kelly becomes leader, so too can other parties **change their course**. Sinn Féin starts the game in the Authoritarian Democrat slot, showing their slightly **heavy-handed approach** towards potential dangers to the institutions of state. This can potentially change to Market Liberal, but the circumstances required for such a change will also be subject to who is leader of the party. Mulcahy is more likely to sooner relax restrictions and reunite the party with Lemass and his colleagues, compared to the more vigilant Collins who would sooner [wait until the threat has passed](https://i.imgur.com/SvHFKtQ.png).

###Economic and Military Matters

All the while that politics are being played, the player will also have the challenge of seeing where they can try to fit in the national foci involved in solely building up Ireland’s economy and military - as this is a war game, after all. With both of these national focus branches, there are two approaches, and the player is free to choose as they wish, but the AI’s choice will depend on their ruling government.

On the **economic** side of things, the player will be able to continue and expand Ireland’s [agricultural-based economy](https://i.imgur.com/wpOCATO.png), collecting varied powerful bonuses in doing so. Alternatively, they may decide that it is a time for a **change of course**, and instead opt for a more radical shift towards more [extensive industrialisation](https://i.imgur.com/IMZYgOV.png). Such a move would be slower and costlier in terms of political power, but offers far more in terms of raw civilian and military factories, rather than varied bonuses. In addition, there is a [shared third sub-branch](https://i.imgur.com/gGdvCVG.png) which deals with matters open to both options. In particular, the enormous industrial complex that makes up the **Harland & Wolff** shipyards in Belfast, is paid special attention, with a lot of content in the forms of a unique [Military Industrial Organisation](https://i.imgur.com/pykx83l.png) or [naval design company](https://i.imgur.com/ZhwKOYD.png), depending on if the player has the Arms Against Tyranny DLC enabled. This can then be [upgraded](https://i.imgur.com/BMvdjo1.png), to give an [expanded MIO](https://i.imgur.com/CchFoYe.png), or [extra design companies](https://i.imgur.com/5yP8Zf3.png) for those without. Structurally, the [economic national focus branch](https://i.imgur.com/Y6lmlNm.png) is associated with the foci available in the immediate phase following Black Monday.

For the **Irish Republican Army**, there are also two approaches. The [first option](https://i.imgur.com/epxow82.png) is slower and more expensive, involving a consumer goods debuff. This places emphasis on **professionalism**, with the Irish army aspiring to reach the levels of the very best, taking inspiration from the Heer, and other armies from the continent and beyond, in an attempt to create an modern, elite fighting force. The [second option](https://i.imgur.com/yYi47in.png) involves building on Ireland’s previous success in the War of Independence, and bringing the lessons learned in **guerilla warfare** into the modern era. The is a more home-grown and less costly endeavour, and conversely gives a consumer goods bonus. The third, [shared sub-branch](https://i.imgur.com/w3CyCF0.png) of the military foci is available to both options, but yields [greater reward](https://i.imgur.com/CEL4fTb.png) if the professionalism option had been taken previously. There are also national foci relating to the completion of [An Balla Éireannach](https://i.imgur.com/KJMKeMw.png), or “the Irish Wall”, a planned complex of coastal fortifications that had been started during the 1920s with German aid after the British Revolution, at a time when a syndicalist invasion looked likely, but were never completed. And finally, there are national foci regarding the development of Ireland’s fledgling [air and naval services](https://i.imgur.com/44G59yj.png). Each of these together make up the [full military national focus branch](https://i.imgur.com/5cFZ9Hn.png).

Narratively, Ireland’s military play a key role during the Gateway to the Atlantic, **looking to intervene** if the government looks likely to fall in the denouement of the Ulster Crisis. However, it is when the war begins that their preparation becomes apparent, as a further **decision category** is unlocked, showcasing the [additional measures](https://i.imgur.com/1K17Tin.png) that can be taken in the defence of the island. There are also a number of unique decisions available, depending on the incumbent government in question.

So what else can you expect from the Ireland rework? Well, one more feature I would like to discuss is the **unique volunteer system**. Ireland’s diaspora are known for centuries of involvement in countless foreign armies on the field of battle, in addition to Ireland in our own timeline having a disproportionate involvement in the Spanish Civil War, with Irish volunteers participating on all sides. To greater emphasise Ireland’s place in the wider world, many of the [familiar conflicts](https://i.imgur.com/ZJDefiV.png) that spring up prior to the Weltkrieg will cause events to fire for Ireland, where the player can choose whether or not they wish to indirectly become involved, and if so, on what side. These events, combined with some other **unique bonuses and decisions**, are intended to make it so that a player can choose to remain **neutral** as Ireland and [stay out of the military factions](https://i.imgur.com/qYTumrD.png), while still being able to participate in the wars that make the mod what it is. If Ireland remains neutral, this can potentially offer a **more relaxed playthrough**, with less simultaneous mechanics going on, and less frontlines to worry about like you would have if you were playing a major. Of course, should a player desire, they can otherwise simply join a major faction and participate directly in the Weltkrieg through conventional means.

***

###Conclusion

For such a small and comparatively insignificant country in the grand scheme of things, I think it’s fair to say that the Irish rework is **momentous** in its scale - it offers **contrasting experiences** in terms of text and overall atmosphere depending on which of the many paths that is being played, there is an unparalleled **cast of characters** in the form of [leaders](https://i.imgur.com/ElVieJZ.png), [commanders and admirals](https://i.imgur.com/N0Jr0k9.png), government-dependent [political advisors](https://i.imgur.com/bjSB3rG.png) and [military advisors](https://i.imgur.com/lU2u8L1.png) - all with their own unique descriptions. And dotted throughout the playthrough, you are sure to come across plenty of dynamic **flavour events** to enrich the setting and make the world more alive. My aims coming into the rework involved retaining as much of the enjoyable and familiar current content, at least on thematic or conceptual level, as possible, while really fleshing and improving the lore on **every single political faction** that plays its part, all the while making as much variety available as could be managed.

All of this would not be possible without those behind the original iteration of this rework so many years ago, **Pietrus** (u/MasterPietrus) and **Celt** (u/LetsTalkAboutVex), who came up with the basic premise of how to improve on the legacy content, and both of whom also came back to help out with the writing later on. A big word also needs to go out to **ZimbabweSaltCo** (/u/ZimbabweSaltCo) for getting the ball rolling on this iteration of the rework and kicking off the tree designs, and **Conchobhar** (u/CascaydeWave) for a lot of the initial writing and lore. However, I cannot mention lore and writing without bringing up the person who has by far helped me the most with both, that being **Sealgaire** (u/An_Sealgaire), who joined in this endeavour at the same time I did. As my own real life has caught up with me with my full-time job, marriage and starting a family, it was clear that my own ability to spend time on the mod would diminish, and more help would be required if I ever hoped for this thing to actually release. Finishing this rework would not be possible without **Klyntar King** (u/Vader_Was_Right) coding and designing a huge amount of the reactionary and socialist content, **Cazadorian** (u/dragonstomper64) implementing the entire later democratic tree and Northern Ireland, **Carmain** (u/Carmain2K14) and **TheIrredentista** (u/TheIrredentista) for improving the political tree design (I suck at tree design), and **IsaacAren** (u/Isaac_Aren) for coming in clutch with the writing in the last few months. And finally, **Deliberus** (u/Deliberus_KR) for making some really inventive and unique effects for Harland & Wolff. This is of course not mentioning all of our artists and testers, without which there would also be no release.

I will leave you all with a picture of the new [full national focus tree](https://i.imgur.com/Y9eaIj9.jpeg) in all its glory. And to avoid speculation, I will confirm that there are **no secret paths** with unique political foci per se, **but** there are few small extra goodies in the form of **additional outcomes and options**, that I have not yet disclosed, though am sure you will uncover these in time. Soon enough, I will be handing you over to Cazadorian to talk through the **Northern Ireland** content, and a little while after that, all going to plan at least, we will have the release. On behalf of the Ireland team, I hope you enjoy the rework.

Mine is County Cavan, Ireland

- Mild, temperature climate
- Ireland is an island and will avoid the worst of mass migration
- Lots of arable land
- Ireland's population is well shorter of what it should be compared to other countries (see the 1840 potato famine)
- Little to no firearm ownership, right wing presence and strong communities
- Cavan has freshwater sources such as lakes and rivers
- Cavan is well elevated compared to the rest of Ireland at around 100m
- Cavan is quite rural, thus avoiding most of the crime from cities when collapse comes
- I'm Irish so I won't stick out like a sore thumb

Potential drawbacks:

- AMOC collapse could plunge winter temperatures below -10°C, killing livestock and destroying crops 
- Atlantic storms will only get worse (see Storm Ciarán)
- Living too close to one of Cavan's many lakes and rivers could lead to flooding
- Cavan's agriculture industry is mostly focused on livestock 
- I have to live in Cavan until collapse comes...","[""Anywhere but where I live now. 1m above sea level behind dikes that will most likely fail. The Dutch like to claim they've fought the sea for hundreds of years but they can't win forever."", ""Is being ok with the first to die a solid collapse strategy? I don't want to be around to watch the world burn."", 'Just stay where I am, northern east Germany, 36m above sea level and according to doomer maps, still more or less habitable at 4C( while I personally do not believe that there are habitable conditions at 4C, due to everything beeing 200% chaotic.)\n\nEdit: fucking autocorrect']",0.08476161995898839,0.4831766917293234,1

Replacing the revamp it received last year, we are delighted to bring you its full rework, and with it all of the internal and external conflict experienced by the party state, as they struggle to bring the revolution to China. And as a surprise bonus - while the full rework of Spain is very much still under way, to freshen up some national foci and events that have been part of the mod for over 7 years now, this release also includes a revamp of the existing Spanish content. We hope you enjoy this large update to one of the most action-filled factions in the mod, as well as all of the other goodies we have included. Kuomin gaming wansui!

### Lt. General Enu Amadu Okorie, African Union Peacemakers 1st Army

These Pooly'i language devices really are something clever, are they not? I am switching back and forth between five languages, and the device - and thus you - are keeping up perfectly! How marvelous... Anyway...    
As soon as I read my unsealed orders, I knew that I was Doomed; my concern then became ensuring that we were not also Damned.

I suppose I should back up. I am a student before all other worldly things; a student of warfare, a student of history, and (although it has no bearing on the events that would unfold) a student of apiculture. I know many truths; I have practiced my trade with some of the best. I have studied with some of the best; I have been on exercises alongside the British Paras and Russian Spetznaz. I have attended joint exercises with Americans, Argentinians, and Australians all; and that's without escaping the letter 'a'. I have studied in some of Europe's finest schools of academia, and I have camped in the Atacama desert.

My parents were not rich people, though they were wealthier than most in Africa at that time, and still would rank among the upper middle-class had they not passed into God's grace years ago. They could afford for me, their only son, a good education though I never took to agriculture the way they they did.

As many young men did when I was a young man some eighty years ago, I joined the army of my homeland hoping for a chance to be a hero. Some would say there are no heroes in war, but I challenge an American to say that Audie Murphy and Alvin York, men whose deeds have outlived them for twice their lifetime and more, were not modern-day Heroes; a Greek or Turk would call them and others like them, like Simo Häyhä, the Immortals of the modern era, so it was possible. There was much strife and occasional war in Africa eighty years ago; I prayed that when the war came, let my homeland be attacked first. It is a Truth known to men that when you are the defender in war, your cause is *righteous indeed;* any Russian will tell you this of the second World War when they were attacked by the Nazis; any Pole and Ukranian can tell you this of Russians, and any man who answers the call to defend his home is a hero.    
I did not wish to be embroiled in a war of aggression. No-one who has begun a war of aggression against a foreign power has prospered from it, or has not been vilified in hindsight, since before the 20th century. This, too, is a Truth that learned men of war know; I prayed that if war came, let it come to me, and let me smite the heathens who dared invade Nigeria, rather than that I be called upon to invade another, as only evil would come to me because of it.

I could talk about the wars of eighty years ago, or the violence that I saw, for days on end. Was it always glory and righteous wrath dispensed upon the heathens? **No.** No it was not, and the youngest version of myself was a damned fool in many ways, but fundamentally he was right; when you are the defender in war, your cause is automatically just and righteous. Your people may have been at one another's throats a day ago, and will band together to fight the invaders, if they have any sense of nationalism at all.    
Eventually, the wars in Africa settled down; a combination of politicking, outside meddling by well-meaning European fools, armament sales into Africa by decidedly malevolent-meaning European fools, caused the African Union to come to be a more powerful body than it had been; prior to sixty years ago, the AU was little more than a shadow of the United Nations internal to Africa, and almost as useless. Where the UN faltered and became an ignored body, until it was disbanded entirely and ultimately the GN would be formed in its place, the African Union donned a gauntlet of steel, and instead of the UN's useless, toothless peace*keepers,* we were armed and uniformed as peace*makers.*

Yes, I know, for a man who has just celebrated his centennial birthday, I certainly don't look more than forty-five, do I? And in truth, I can still do military PT the way I could when I was thirty. Why do you think disgustingly rich and old foreigners keep traveling to Nigeria, South Africa, Ethiopia and Egypt for medical care? Anyway...

The AU is not and never was quite a fully Federal body, and it could certainly be understood that the Peacemakers' formation was essentially funded by a combination of disgustingly-rich African businessmen and their foreign business partners who had grown tired of the instability that the frankly exhausting litany of wars, rebellions, ethnic cleansings, etc, brought to their business dealings. The AU was reborn in cabal and oligarchy; the armies of Nigeria, Morocco, Egypt, Ethiopia, Kenya, and South Africa, made a compact under the auspices of the AU; we simply would not tolerate any more wars in Africa, and if anyone *did* start up significant violence, we would *all* come down, hard and fast, on whomever fired the first shot; whatever the provocation, whatever their reasons: if you *start* the war, the Peacemakers *end* the war, and then we end *you.*    
This was true when ethnic violence in the south of Sudan started again; tribe against tribe. The tribe who attacked first had their reasons of course; the other tribe was stealing their cattle (without firing bullets), was grazing cattle on their pasturage. We didn't care; our remit was to stop conflicts in Africa, and to side *against* the party that fired the first shot rather than be bogged down in questions of provocation, retaliation for a past wrong, etc. Our goal was deterrence, pure and simple; if you *start* a significant conflict in Africa, we end you.    
We ended that conflict, we dragged the men who had been responsible for the start of the conflict before the tribe they had aggressed against, and asked them what punishment they would see meted out.    
They said only death would satisfy them for the loss of their men; so we tied the men to posts and shot them. Then we took them down and gave them proper burials.

It was just as true when the President of Nigeria decided that Benin (which was unfortunately greatly in debt owing to economic hardships at the time) would have to default *land* to Nigeria in lieu of payment in hard currency. I suppose, technically, Benin *should* have relinquished the land; the prior government of Benin *had* put the land up as collateral, and the then-current government refused to relinquish it. The president of Nigeria decided to move the army of Nigeria in and simply expel any Benin military who would not lay down arms, accept their new rulers, or simply leave. The Beninese were understandably unwilling to simply fold without a fight, and shots were fired. It was considered the true test of the Peacemakers; Nigeria was a founding member of the Peacemakers. How would we jump? Everyone expected, of course, that we would enforce the land grab as being legitimate, that the AU would be nothing more than any other strongman's army, answering to a cabal of rich thugs.    
We did not, thankfully. Our orders at that time were clear; Nigeria had fired the first shots, Nigeria's army had to be stopped, and the accountable party brought to justice. I had the dubious pleasure of drawing my handgun and pointing it at the head of the President I had voted for in the previous election; uniformed not as a Nigerian, but as a Peacemaker. I ordered him to surrender or die on the spot. He surrendered. The Benin government sentenced him to exile from Africa upon pain of death should he return; we took him to the nearest airport and put him on a plane. When last I heard of him, he had passed away in Moscow.

Since the dawn of the 22nd century, the Peacemakers have, mostly, kept a lid on violence in Africa. It flares up from time to time; we have to maintain an army of substantial size and readiness. The various governments of the nations *of* Africa maintain their own standing armies of course; none of them trusted us entirely, and if we they all rose up as one and decided that the AU experiment was over, we would fight hard and die. But for the most part, our presence is welcomed, because we do not interfere in civil wars, but we do prevent the government next door from taking what is yours. Yes, I am well aware of the bitter irony and hypocrisy and inconsistency of cracking down on small rebel groups and ethnic cleansing and tribal warfare, but allowing large-enough civil wars to 'have it out.'    
I never claimed the system was ideal, but it's a step towards a more idealistic system than we had previously.

In any event, the AU Peacemakers were by this point a strong enough force that the AU felt comfortable and able to sign mutual-defense pacts; The Mediterranean Mutual Defense Pact, for example, had been signed by the African Union; by Spain, Italy, Croatia, Albania, Greece, Cyprus, Syria, and Israel. The MMDP's terms were simple; if any such nation were attacked by any nation which could be reached by the Mediterranean Sea, the rest of us ganged up on them. If they were attacked elsewhere, we would reinforce them at home and logistically, allowing them to focus their energies abroad.

Thus, when Greece was attacked in Korea, the MMDP came into play, in principle. In practice, only the AU really responded under the MMDP; everywhere on the northern side of the Mediterranean was a NATO member and was responding under that auspice. Syria (and co) and Israel were busy staring at one another and deciding whether or not to have a titanic Middle Eastern war now that nukes were off the table, though the Israelis did promise help once could they muster enough forces to be secure at home as well.    
Italy, Greece, and Spain were already moving their forces north, and to the far east. They called upon Africa to reinforce them at home, to provide supplies and logistical assistance; to be boots on the ground should the Russians or Chinese somehow get troops (or more probably, airstrikes) within range of them.

And so it was that I was ordered to take my army to Greece. I was given a sealed envelope with sealed orders to be read once I had arrived and begun distributing my men to the defensive positions we were being welcomed into, to our forward operating bases, once we had begun supplying the Greeks who were in the process of mobilizing. I assumed when I took possession of the envelope that it was 'go to Hell' orders; what to do if we found ourselves somehow facing a massive Russian armored thrust that somehow broke through all of Middle Europe; if we started to come under attack by orbital artillery, or the likes.    
The orders I read made me want to vomit; both in disgust, and because of the magnitude of doom we were bringing upon ourselves. My orders were to *seize* Greece. To stab the Greeks in the back, to attack and destroy, or else capture, the Greek units that were currently mobilized and preparing to go to war, to prevent the reserve units from mustering, to disarm and forcibly disband the Greek police and establish martial law.    
Those orders *could* be accomplished, those specific tasks achieved. Greece's best forces were either in Korea, or already *en route* to Korea; what remained was garrison troops, reservists, and units being mustered. It would be no mean feat; I have studied Greek military history and I know that even with their best warriors abroad, the Greeks would not simply surrender without a fight, even with a gun's barrel metaphorically pressed to their shoulderblades from behind; but I knew the forces I had under my command. I knew we *could* do it.

I also knew that it would not end well for us one way or the other. We would be throwing away half a century's tradition of enforcing peace and good order by being the aggressors; and doing so in just about the most egregiously treacherous manner possible, betraying a sworn ally who called upon us for aid. Furthermore, I knew that the end goal; having World War III, having it quickly, on the side of what the West calls the Axis of Denied Empires, of seizing Europe's population centers quickly, of *destroying* the Americas' ability to easily project force overseas, and presenting ourselves as representing the majority of the planet and thus, having the right to speak on behalf of Earth in telling the aliens to begone, was simply not feasible. Those were my assumptions about the high-level strategic plans being inserted into the ear of Africa from Moscow and Beijing, and I know from the reports of the interrogations that that was indeed, the line that Lagos was being fed.

We were *Doomed.* Just like the Fascists of the early 20th and 21st Century, the best we could hope for was to make some early, *stunning gains* by blitzkrieg, and then we would be *ground under the treads* of the United States of America, if not stalled and spitted upon the bayonets of France and Germany and England. Truthfully, my army could not even have seized Greece alone had we been fighting them at their best, man-to-man, face-to-face, instead of stabbing them in the back.    
I am a student of military history; I knew this. The fools in Lagos were students of *money* and Russian 'realpolitik,' they were *willfully ignorant* of it. But I am a soldier; I swore an oath to obey. Also, there was no way 'out,' not really.    
Yes, I gave it thought, serious thought. I considered informing the Greeks of my orders, of leading my army in rebellion, in defiance of our orders, of siding firmly with Greece and NATO, but that would not have been accepted by my troops. Even if my immediate subordinates were wise enough and well-educated enough to agree with me in that this was blasphemy, madness; perhaps even Sparta, unlike myself, most of them were family men. Could such a family man follow me in a righteous rebellion, if it would mean a rifle put to his daughter's back and fired if he refused to shoot me? Would my soldiers? *I* could take that risk - what would they do, execute my bees? But I could not ask my men to cause their wives and sons and daughters to be shot for their actions.

It was not an option. So I resolved that if the AU and the Peacemakers would be vilified by history, let there be an asterisk in the history book, and let the footnote say that the 1st Peacemakers had comported themselves with distinction and responsibility, and scrupulously adhered to the laws and customs of warfare. That is why the first orders I issued were to establish the three-buddies-and-a-stranger system; soldiers would go nowhere but in groups of four, one of whom was to be from another unit entirely seconded to them. That all looting, theft, violence against civilians, and especially murder and rape, were to be abhorred at all costs; especially that last. Rape in warfare has a long and unfortunate history, and some of the Truths that many men at arms know is that when they have the pleasure of occupying lands that are not theirs, they have liberties they may freely take at the expense of the occupied. I would *not* have that Truth be known among my army, and *that* I could control; I ordered that even an *accusation* of rape that could not be defended against by a credible alibi would result in detention indefinitely; and that the punishment for a provable, or overwhelmingly-likely, allegation, would be punished by being dragged to the place of accusation in irons, and *whatever* punishment short of torture the people there saw fit to decree summarily meted out; the same for murder. My orders about beatings, pillage and looting were similar, save that the life of the perpetrator was not on the table.    
Thankfully, I had the distinct pleasure of leading the most professionally-trained, the most well-equipped, and most-disciplined of armies in Africa; and also most likely the most well-educated. I encouraged education among the soldiers under my command, I paid stipends for them to take higher learning. The soldiers knew as soon as my orders were distributed what was going on. The 'three-buddies-and-a-stranger' system was implemented quickly. And we struck at dawn on the third day after the Korean Cold War became hot again.

Greece fell quickly, in terms of invading the entirety of Greece. It was a foregone conclusion, frankly, with their army's best abroad in Korea. Those who remained, well... They put up a hell of a struggle, considering they were being stabbed in the back by an ally whom they had trusted. Fifty years of reputation of always siding with the first-attacked party was likely the reason the African Union Peacemakers had been entrusted with supporting Greece, Italy and Spain; fifty years of good reputation cashed-in for one stab in the back.    
Greece fell quickly; Italy and Spain were never wholly subdued, but my orders were to proceed onwards through Albania, North Macedonia and Bulgaria. Our orders were to avoid conflict with the Turks at all costs; I was to issue orders, in fact, that until countermanded, my soldiers were to endure fire from Turkish sources without firing upon them in retaliation. At Political levels, I understood, the Turks were straddling the fence between their NATO allies and their Russian and Chinese trading partners.    
Yes, we took Greece. Albania had neglected their armed forces to a substantial degree; the North Macedonians and Bulgars substantially less so. By the time we were in Tirana, the entire north coast of the Aegean Sea was an untenable position to hold. Within a week we had been forced back, ironically, as far as Epirus, and were now defending it against the Greeks' liberators, being promised reinforcements (that I knew would not be coming) and ordered to hold the line. We were always meant to be the distraction; but an effective distraction. Our presence in the Mediterranean forced the European powers into a war on three fronts, forced them to commit Armour and air power that they required facing Russia to the Mediterranean.    
Eventually, of course, the foregone transpired. A *lot* of people in Africa were justifiably furious at what the AU's 'leadership' had done; while it was a Truth known to most Africans that no foreigner can be wholly trusted, and especially not the Western ones for they are even more bedeviling with their smiles and promises of friendship and charity and all the more evil for it than the Russians and Chinese with their openly unfavorable loans and armaments for dictators, it was also a Truth known to most Africans than getting ourselves involved in this war was a colossal mistake, and would almost certainly see NATO forces rolling into Cairo and Lagos before long. By the time my army had been forced back to the Peloponnese and Crete, and with NATO warplanes dropping guided ordnance on Peacemaker bases in Africa, there was a widespread coup in Africa, and the AU was deposed. Our leadership in the rear was gone, our forces in Spain and Italy were being mauled, and I ordered my army to lay down arms and surrender.    
Was it a successful campaign? Tactically it was; I achieved all of my initial objectives. The strategic goal was impossible, but it was not mine to question why; it was my lot to do, or die. We fought hard; despite our initial gains being a stab in the back for which no glory can be claimed, my army acquitted itself with distinction once we were facing an enemy who was facing towards us. We fought a hell of a lot better and harder than any European or American would have thought any army from Africa could or would fight them. And in the end?

Well, my colleagues leading the second and third Peacemaker Armies are dead. Boubacar took his own life; chased north from Sicily and trapped against the rock of the Alps, he shot himself not more than a kilometer from where Mussolini was shot dead - in preference to being captured by the Italians; I think he expected to share Il Duce's fate and chose Hitler's way out instead. Ife was captured by the Spaniards, and hanged at the Hauge. Myself? Well, I am still around to talk about it; not one soldier under my command was convicted of a war crime, and less than ten were even accused credibly enough for the matter to be investigated. Our cause was betrayed by our leadership; our integrity robbed from us from above in a vainglorious grasp at Imperial power in which we could never have been anything but the most junior of partners even had it all gone perfectly to plan. But only *we* could relinquish our self-respect, our dignity, our humanity; and *those* things we held onto with both fists, even when we had lost our rifles.    
Tewodros and the 4th? Israel honored its commitments to the MMDP; Spain, Italy and Greece were quite obviously attacked, and called upon NATO, the EU and the Mediterranean MDP for aid. When Tewodros laid down arms, he was fully-committed to holding the Israelis off in the Sinai. I think he could have held another week before being forced back to the Suez. Longer, if the Middle East had gone up in flames while he was still fighting and Israel had found itself in a two-front war. Once the AU had collapsed behind him and he was facing the prospect of the Egyptian Army in the rear and Israel in the front, he quite wisely choose to negotiate a surrender.

And the larger picture? I thought this all *was* madness. Had the various Presidents and dictators making up the AU Council been available to me, I would have found the deepest, driest well in Sparta and kicked them all down it! Humankind had been demonstrated not to be alone in the cosmos. Yes, Africa was right, I think, to feel more than slighted that the West had refused to transfer us their Hyperdrive technology, even in exchange for technologies they desperately wanted and we held onto with both fists.    
Even so, here we were, fighting at home; stabbing our erstwhile allies in the back no less; when there are demonstrably hostile aliens out among the Stars. I should have been mobilizing the 1st Peacemakers to go to war to defend humanity as a whole amongst the stars, not seizing Athens on behalf of a dictator in Moscow. But then, that's why I'm a successful general, rather than a politician, I suppose. Madness.

### Major Elif Gauthier, 1st Littleuropa Chasseurs

Four years ago, I was a Capitaine of the *Bataillon de Chasseurs Ardennais.* I had rose quickly enough in the Belgian Army, I supposed; I was twenty-four years old, and commanded the 2nd Company - of three. There just wasn't much money for the Army to maintain a larger standing infantry force; it is *surprisingly* expensive to raise, train, equip, keep trained, keep readied, a single infantryman who isn't making a fraction of the money spent on keeping him able to soldier. Beancounters may moan about the price of equipment, but they rage at you as if you're demanding they hand over a *kidney* about the prices of soldiers.

And yet, the Chasseurs Ardennais remained a high-readiness unit. We were most often used for wilderness search and rescue and paramilitary law enforcement assistance, but we trained, drilled, and we were *skilled.* We remained true to our original purpose when the batallion was first raised in 1933; fast infantry, skilled and equipped to move *fast* in woodlands, to harass and deny a hypothetical enemy area control for as long as humanly possible.

Why did I leave? Advancement; specifically, the *lack* thereof. I joined out of university as an Aspirant, was promoted to Sous-lieutenant upon graduation from military school. I quickly enough made Lieutenant, and then, I lucked out, when another man's luck *ran* out. My Capitaine was injured horrifically in a training accident; off his quad, headfirst into a tree. He lived, but even with modern medical miracles, he was unfit for military service and was discharged.    
I spent two years as Capitaine, and I got a look at the Land Component's history of promotions. The last officer promotion of OF-3 or up was when *I* had been promoted. The last time before that was when the old Colonel retired and ranks moved up - that was when I was advanced from Sous-lieutenant to Lieutenant.

The Land Component was small, it not expanding, and the only advancement was dead man's boots; either someone a grade or more above you died and created an opening, or got old or tired of the military and resigned.    
I wanted to be a Major before I was thirty; but from the statistical analysis of things, it was going to take until I was *sixty.* I mean, unless World War III broke out, but what were the odds of *that,* right?

My little sister had moved out to Littleuropa when she was 18. It was her way of getting away from our father; my way was joining the military. We had exchanged letters every time the hyperpulse fired. We had talked previously about how they were scouring the colony for military experience and coming up with not much but very old men and men who had been cashiered for bad conduct; after the Pooly'i arrived at Newcastle-upon-the-Stars, they were desperate enough to actually try to pay to poach serving or just-mustered-out soldiers from Earth. I asked her how that was going, and they had a fair number of Enlisted, but a dearth of officers worth a damn.

I struggled with the decision, I really did. I *liked* being part of an historical unit, *the* famous unit which had held up Rommel and all of his Panzers until they'd literally shot all their bullets and had nothing left to fight with. I liked riding my bike at reckless speeds through the woods, too, though after being promoted I hardly ever got to saddle up save for training quals and my own time; officers above lieutenant commanded from inside vehicles for the most part. I suppose I'm an adrenaline junkie; in hindsight, perhaps I never should have been promoted above Capitane, since any higher than that and your chances of actually seeing any action, should it happen, become next to nil unless things have gone *entirely* to *merde.*    
Heh. It seems that if you *really* focus, you can make a word remain untranslated. Good.

In any event, I 'happened' to mention in passing to the Capitaine-commandant (the unit second-in-command) that my sister's colony was looking to recruit military personnel. I was feeling the waters out. He laughed, and said that if I went, I should take as many men as I could get to follow me; the budget-counters would be grateful!    
There is a quaint phrase I have since learned from the yankees here; *'Militious* Compliance.' I had just been *given an instruction* by my *lawful superior* to take as many recruits with me to the stars as I could! And I did just that; I convinced a Lieutenant under me, and thirty-eight enlisted ranging from Caporal-chef to Soldat to follow me. Forty Belgian rifles went to the stars, looking for a new life; untamed wilderness to explore; the possibility of defending humanity from the bug-monsters; career advancement; or simply to get as far as humanly possible from their in-laws.

We had a contract to spend ten years' time in the Littleuropa Army, primarily our duty was expected to be forming the nucleus of an army raised locally; to train and expand said army organically. After a month in Hyperspace, we arrived as one, got our new shots and etc., upon arriving, and went to see our new commanding officer as a unit.    
What we found was a weatherbeaten old man who looked to be in his early sixties (though I would later learn he was in his late seventies), wearing a stetson hat with a pair of silvery star on it. Our new commander was a Yankee. *Merde!*

My first, *immediate* thought, was that General Simmons was a pretentious blow-hard air-bag who was taking the opportunity to jump himself up with unearned rank owing to the lack of anyone to say he couldn't call himself a general. *Thankfully,* we were not quite that badly off; rather the opposite, in fact. General Walter Simmons had been the Major General commanding the United States Army's 101st Airborne Division, though he had retired twenty years ago. In his own words, he'd had so much more than enough of American politics that the day after his retirement, he and his wife had boarded literally the first ship heading to a colony.

It took us a little time to speak eye-to-eye, so to speak; although we both spoke English, we weren't exactly speaking the same tongue, especially as regards what skills and experience I and the soldiers who came with me brought with us. Fortunately, after I resorted to drawing out the APP-7 symbol of the *Bataillon de Chasseurs Ardennais,* he laughed and understood immediately; 'you're mobile infantry recon-in-force!'

I should talk about Littleuropa, I suppose; at a population of 40,000,000, it was no small place. Larger than either of Luzes Dançantes and Nueva Estrella, though not larger than both. It was colonized long enough that the young recruits we were going to be training were native-born. Littleuropa - a pun on 'Mittleuropa' - was so named because, if one squinted a little, the most auspicious continent to colonize bore a somewhat-more-than-merely-passing resemblance to all of Europe from Portugal (inclusive) to Russia (exclusive), and had kind-of-similar islands to Ireland, Great Britain, Iceland, and an island stand-in for the northern Scandanavian countries; Norway, Sweden and Finland. There were other continents on Littleuropa, but the population of all of them combined amounted to less than one-quarter of a million persons. And as it was colonized twenty-five years ago, almost all of it was still virgin territory.    
And somehow, the commanding officer of the Littleuropa Army was a Stetson-wearing Texan who had signed up, leaving his horse ranch in *Noespaña.* Such is life sometimes.

Over the next few years, we put together what military we *could,* but there was no real sense of *urgency* for the most part. The Poolies had, after all, proved to be friendly - and also, it seemed unlikely we could do more than offer token resistance if they turned hostile, even with the most modern armaments Earth had to offer. We expanded, and we trained, but our focus was primarily *para*military duties rather than hurting things and breaking people. We developed an indigenous set of equipment appropriate to the most pressing of our duties;

The Blazer Mk. 2; a 6x6 wheeled bike for one or two;    
The Mustang Mk. 2; a 4x4 armored, light combat all-terrain vehicle - essentially an armored pickup truck as known to Americans, which can be reconfigured with or without a number of mission packages and armaments;    
The Warthog Mk. 1; a 6x8 heavy wheeled multirole combat vehicle; the inexperienced called it a wheeled tank, but it was more of an IFV/multi-mission platform;    
The Dolphin Mk. 1; a two-person, ducted-ionized-air-driven (DIAD) VTOL, specced out as a multirole attack VTOL but largely equipped only with sensors;    
The Orca Mk. 1; a four-crew, DIAD VTOL with armament and transport capability of up to one 11-man squad of infantry or a Mustang and its crew (up to 6);    
The Beluga Mk. 2; a four-crew DIAD VTOL with armament and transport capability of up to two 11-man squads and a vehicle up to a Warthog in size along with its crew.

We had vehicles, we had the basics required, but after the initial panic of the Pooly'i landing on Newcastle-upon-the-Stars that had resulted in a dire requirement for personnel and equipment, the government of Littleuropa was consistently shy about producing anything heavy. Of course they bemoaned the expense, but they were more afraid of maintaining a standing military with any real capabilities for fear of a coup.    
On the one hand I can understand that concern; on the other hand, it was exactly that concern that led to the French militia being so poorly-trained and unready when they were attacked in 1940; and it was exactly that gun-shyness about maintaining a military that led the French high command to be full of headless chickens when it all kicked off.

So, when the Horcin invaded Newcastle-upon-the-Stars, we were largely unready from a military perspective, but the government of the colony thought they *were* ready; we had a standing military of 40,000, we had wheeled vehicles more than adequate for traversing our entire continent, we had rifles and machine pistols, a small number of shoulder launchers, machine guns for our vehicles and crew-served, and a few light cannons that served well to terrify the hell out of the civilian ministers who watched them go off, but were absolutely inadequate in the face of real armor.

By the time the Horcin invaded Newcastle, General Simmons had passed. He had spent his remaining years educating myself and the rest of his officer corps, and drilling the enlisted relentlessly, rather than pushing day and night for more and better equipment. In his estimation, and I don't disagree, the best-equipped army in this world or any other is useless if the soldiers are ill-prepared, poorly-disciplined, and have no morale or buy-in to either the military or their homelands, but the most poorly-equipped but *determined* soldiers will *find* a way. He believed that the best leadership was setting an example, rather than screaming and shouting - not what I had expected from an American. He was as a result of taking PT every day with the men incredibly fit, until one day, he simply fell on the exercise field and we could not revive him. I think if he couldn't die in battle against a foreign adversary, or in bed with his wife, dying as a soldier would have been his third choice.

We were two Divisions strong when the Horcin attacked Newcastle. Primarily I would have characterized us as motorized and mechanized infantry; we had no tanks at all, only theoretical anti-tank capability, no aerospace beyond our VTOLs, no navy to speak of beyond a few experimental boats suitable only for river and lake usage, no orbital assets beyond satellite nets. Prototypes of heavier weapons had been developed, but the government had consistently refused to produce more than a handful.    
The startling news that Newcastle had been attacked and was being occupied terrified the government, and rightly so. Quite literally overnight, the budget for defense was literally a blank check. Amazing how that happens, isn't it?

Being the 27-year-old Major in charge of the Littleuropa Chasseurs, I was quite pleased with the emphasis on wheeled vehicles, but I knew that wars are not won with armored cars, no matter how much you love them and how reckless and daredevil the drivers. I also knew that our Warthog was little more than a pale shadow of the Australian Razorback M3, let alone the might of the Chieftain VII, M2 Dempsey, or other modern tank. Quite frankly, the main military forces of forty years ago would easily defeat the army we had in a stand-up fight, let alone god-knows-what that space aliens are going to bring.    
A year and two months is simply not enough time to develop a *good* tank, work out all the kinks, and bring it to production. Of course we were trying; and all the weapons we had developed and prototyped, we'd started building. So at least we had shoulder launchers and the heavier cannons that our vehicles *would* take; *someone* had pulled some favors and gotten someone on Earth to send us the schematics for last generation's ground-to-air missiles and ground-attack missiles suitable for mounting on our VTOLs. They were *China's* last-gen missiles, but beggars cannot be choosers.

With every factory that could handle heavy equipment turned to armament and a sudden mandate to triple the size of the military, we were caught with our trousers half-way up our legs when the invasion came to us; quite unexpectedly, as to be honest we were all clustered around the hypercomm, watching and speculating about the drama of WWIII unfolding on Earth.    
I admit, I felt the blood leave my face when our space-watchers reported that there were hyperspace entries in-system. For a moment I wanted to cry; for a moment, I gave a thought to suggesting that we simply surrender without a fight.    
*Bordel de merde!* The *hell* we would! And I could tell that the very same thoughts ran through the mind of everyone in the room. We would have a day, maybe two, until they were upon us. So we made ready.

Yes, we knew that by calling the fleet that had been heading for PanAm and telling them about the invasion, we would be extending their time in Hyperspace by a week; that it would take them three weeks to reach *us,* and put them seven weeks from Earth when we called them, assuming they reached our system, heard the news from Earth, and turned around without even stopping...  But what choice did we have? We weren't going to be able to fully-repulse an alien invasion, and we were *quite* clear about that with the government. We could delay, we could harass, we could launch a guerilla war that would make what they faced on Newcastle look like a picnic, but we *could not* stop the aliens from landing, nor drive them off Littleuropa by ourselves. And we *didn't* have the benefit of a Pooly orbital system to shred their largest transport, either. Our tank prototypes were woefully inadequate, we simply did not have enough of them, and they simply had not given us enough heavier other weapons to do the job, because they had spent years fretting about us couping rather than trusting us to defend the planet.    
We laid out, step-by-step, the expected dance steps in the, as the yankees so charmingly put it, 'charlie foxtrot' we were going to dance; even presuming the aliens declined to bombard us from orbit, they were going to establish air supremacy within, at most, a week. We could fight them in the cities, if they were prepared to accept *a lot* of civilian casualties, we could shoot down the odd jet or hostile VTOL, we could rain hell on their tanks from time to time... But ultimately, better-equipped forces *would* take territory. But, we could hold out long enough, fight them hard enough, fuck up their timetable enough, for them not to have total control by the time the relief forces arrived.

*If* the Horcin had not established total control of the planet by the time the relief arrived, we reckoned, they'd land and crush the Horcin. But if the enemies had had time to dig in and there was nothing left but *la resistance?* They would most likely say 'Littleuropa can wait' and turn around to relieve NATO on Earth. We would *have* to resist and bite; to give the bulls hell, like a matador dancing around an enormous beast, until reinforcements arrived.

The government relented. They told us to hold out for as long as we could, until the reinforcements could get here; and *that* is what we did.

The new form is desktop and mobile compatible and allows users to accurately provide the location using GPS.

Chief Veterinary Officer for Northern Ireland, Dr. Robert Huey said: “The reporting of dead wild birds by the public is a key component of the Department’s Avian Influenza surveillance program and helps us understand if the virus is present in Northern Ireland and how it is distributed geographically. 

“Previously, dead waterfowl (swans, geese, or ducks) or other wild birds, such as gulls or birds of prey, were reported to the DAERA helpline, but this new online method will make it much faster and easier for findings to be reported and will greatly enhance the wild bird surveillance program.

“The public’s continuing help is vital and I encourage anyone who comes across a dead wild bird to report it through the website on their computer or mobile device as soon as possible.”

Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza (HPAI) H5N1 continues to be detected in wild birds across Northern Ireland in various locations most notably in Black Headed Gull breeding colonies.

Dr Huey continued: “Considering the most recent HPAI confirmations in wild birds, there is now an increasing likelihood of incursion into kept flocks. I would like to take this opportunity to remind all birdkeepers that it is a legal requirement to register your birds.  This applies to all birds except those kept in your own home. This is to enable the Department to provide you with up-to-date information about Avian Influenza and the measures you can take to prevent spread to your birds. 

“The risk of an Avian Influenza incursion to poultry remains and the disease, once in poultry flocks, has a devastating impact on our local industry. It is therefore vitally important to maintain high levels of biosecurity as individual site biosecurity remains a crucial mitigation factor. A self-assessment biosecurity checklist and guidance has been developed to assist poultry keepers and is available on the DAERA website. 

“Guidance should be adhered to as much as is practically possible to keep your birds safe and help prevent the spread of disease from wild birds, or another source, to poultry.

“Officials continue to closely monitor the situation across the UK and the Republic of Ireland to determine the risk level to poultry flocks in Northern Ireland and will keep under review all tools available in our efforts to prevent any incursion into our local flocks. The ongoing cooperation and assistance of all birdkeeprs is key to this.”

For further information on what to do if you find a dead wild bird and a link to the new online reporting tool please see the Wild Birds and Advice for the Public section on the DAERA Avian Influenza hub.

DAERA will collect some dead wild birds for Avian Influenza surveillance purposes, however once HPAI has been detected in a specific area, further testing is not required and therefore, not all birds will be collected. It is the responsibility of landowners to dispose safely of dead birds found on their premises and further information is available on the DAERA website.   

Notes to editors: 
Once disease has been detected in a specific area, further testing is not required and therefore not all birds will be collected.
DAERA also encourages all birdkeepers to register for the AI text alert service which will give immediate notification of any important disease information.

Humans are NOT Crazy...they are worse,1087,HFY,https://www.reddit.com/r/HFY/comments/18225bb/humans_are_not_crazythey_are_worse/,1700749062.0,"**Humans are not Crazy…they are Insane**

“Someone give the report on the Terran Alliance and tell me if it is worth… ‘integrating’ the Humans into our workforce.” The Emperor of the Mx’kthali Star Empire called out.

“Permission to speak freely without reprisal, your Majesty.” His Chief of Intelligence, Prominence Executive Chak immediately responded.

“Permission granted.” The Emperor replied.

“Thank you, your Majesty. Forgive me, but are you out of your mind? The Humans are Crazy, Insane and everything else. Declaring war on them, let alone enslaving them, is a recipe for disaster.” Chak responded.

“Explain.” The Emperor said over the roars of outrage of his boot kissers.

“True, they may seem to be a united people, but in truth they are as factional as the supporters of one of their Team Sport Games…unless there is something to unite them…say someone declaring war on them in order to enslave them. In that case, may the Gods help us.

They have no single Political structure…it appears as though their people are governed by dozens of different groups, each representing a different political structure. Some allow the people full control of their territories, others allow their people to vote for what decision is taken by the Politicians. There are a few Totalitarian parties that look like Monarchies instead of anything else.

They may be, in terms of FTL capability, the youngest species within the Galaxy…but each and every one of their ships is outfitted with their mass produced FTL drives. There is no way that each and every one of them will ever be caught. They can, and will, simply disperse in all directions.

Their Military is more divided than the sand at the coast, each division different from the next, no sense of unity to be found between the individual units. Gods, even their weapons differ, some units using Energy based weapon systems, the next wields archaic kinetic weaponry. The Humans cannot even decide on a single military doctrine to employ during times of war. I mean, during their first contact war where the Ktniners tried to enslave them…that short 3 year conflict…the humans employed on average 20-30 different strategies each month, each distinctly different from the other. This included everything from so-called ‘Zerg-rushing’, where the Humans attacked in one big massive frontal charge, to ‘Blitzkrieg’, where the Humans focussed a strong assault on a narrow point, generally where the Ktniner lines were the weakest, breaking through and causing massive havoc behind enemy lines…at least, that is what I understood from the reports our observers sent back.

Their Economy, granted, is far superior to ours in structure and flexibility, whilst our output is far greater than theirs. They can, and have on numerous occasions in their History, convert entire sectors of their Economy into War production facilities, and once the war was over, they simply undid the changes they did and get on with life.” Chak said.

“So, what is the problem then?” one of the Emperor’s boot lickers asked, no doubt trying to earn favour by asking the big question. Jokes on him. Chak was not yet finished with his report, and the Emperor is an old friend of his.

“As I have stated before, if threatened, the Humans will unite into a singular entity and act as though controlled by a Hive mind. During my visit to the Sol System from where they originate I have discovered that Humans are Deathworlders. Whilst at first glance their planet, Earth or Terra depending on which person you ask in any one of their hundreds of languages, another thing that is infuriating about Humans, can be classified as a class 2 Agricultural world, were it not for the abundance of Water on the planet.

That is until you land on the surface. Global Average temperatures along the equator average at well over 5 degrees higher than that of our own Homeworld, bone dry deserts ready to evaporate all the fluid in your body in what feels like seconds, sweltering Rainforests and arid ice/snow sheets where the moisture content in the air is even lower than that of a blasted Desert.” Chak continued, silently smiling at the looks of horror on the faces of the Councillors.

“How can any species survive in such an abysmal planet?” another boot licker asked.

“The humans don’t just survive in that hell, they evolved in it and revel in it’s infernal climates.” Chak began speaking again. “And not only that, that Planet has the widest variety of Ecosystems I have personally ever seen on a singular planet. And the Humans…they have armed forces dedicated to fighting in each and every one of them.

And that is not even the worst part.”

A shiver seemed to go through the chamber at those words.

“Please, explain.” The emperor requested, looking a bit pale. He knew that I was not one to lie, especially in front of my friends.

“The Humans have something called…an ‘Internet’. It is a collective database of seemingly immeasurable size, most of which is accessible to each and every member of the Human race. This includes some rather…vivid images that, even now, 15 years later, I still try to forget.

And Gods above, the horrors of Adverts on the Internet. Thank the Gods a young teenager taught me the uses of Adblockers.

Anyway, I am getting sidetracked.

The Humans have something they call 'MMO Games'…except those things weren’t games. The Humans are training their youth to become savage soldiers with their 'Milsim', short for Military Simulation, ‘games’, commanders through the use of ‘Real Time Strategy’ games and mass murderers with ‘Hack and Slash’ games, all of which include ‘Achievements’ whereby the ‘Players’ need to slaughter/kill/defeat massive amounts of their opponents, some of whom are modelled after members of the Galactic Community.”

“I am starting to believe that the term ‘Crazy’ may not be an apt description for Humanity.” The Minister of War commented.

“It get’s worse. As you know, ethanol alcohol is a highly poisonous substance to most individuals in the Galactic Community…the Humans consume that stuff on a near daily basis. Hell, the individuals in nations called Ireland, Russia, the United States of America, Germany, Australia and many others are able to drink the ferocious Thorktug under the table without trying, then continue on challenging the others throughout the night. Oh, that reminds me: if you encounter an intoxicated Human during your travels and he/she smells of Alcohol, it would be highly advisable to run. For your own sanity if you are lucky, for your life if you aren’t.” Chak explained.

“Their food is exceptional however. Amongst the many souvenirs I brought back from my visit, I am proudly in possession of numerous large tomes of knowledge revolving solely around their culinary arts.”

Just then a messenger burst into the room.

“Your Majesty, forgive the intrusion.” The soldier called out, holding the seal of the intelligence department high in the air.

“Report, Soldier.” The Emperor commanded.

“The Haxus Dominion has declared war on the Humans.” The soldier spoke up. ""They wish to enslave them.""

Chak released a sigh. “I bet my collection of Books on Human Culinary arts that the humans will win the war in a year.”

“I’ll take that bet.” The Minister of War said. “I’ll bet my personal Heavy Cruiser that the Dominion will destroy the Terran Alliance in at least 5 years.

“Did I forget to mention, the Humans can play dirty?” I wondered out loud.

“What did you expect the Humans to do then?” the Empress Consort, my older sister, asked.

“Honestly? I expected the Terran Navy to route the Haxus Fleet, then launch an all-out invasion deep into Haxus territory, culminating in an invasion of Haxus Prime itself.” Chak said.

“Oh come on. Surely they are not that stupid.” The Emperor said.

- The Imperial Japanese Army's notorious medical research team carried out secret human experiments regarded as some of the worst war crimes in history. Its scientists subjected more than 10,000 people per year to grotesque Josef Mengele-style torture in the name of science, including captured Russian soldiers and downed American aircrews. The experiments included hanging people upside down until they choked, burying them alive, injecting air into their veins and placing them in high-pressure chambers. http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/asia/japan/7236099/Human-bones-could-reveal-truth-of-Japans-Unit-731-experiments.html (http://archive.is/hojxN)

- Guatemala syphilis experiment: American medical research project that lasted from 1946 to 1948 and is known for its unethical experimentation on vulnerable human populations in Guatemala. The Guatemala experiments remained a largely unknown event in U.S. medical history until the early 2000s. The total study population included more than 5,500 Guatemalan prisoners, sex workers, soldiers, children, and psychiatric patients, about one-quarter of whom were deliberately infected with syphilis, gonorrhea, or chancroid and all of whom were enrolled in the experiments without their consent. Among the most controversial methods used was “normal exposure,” in which sex workers infected with syphilis were used to transmit the disease to unsuspecting prisoners. Approximately 1,308 soldiers, prisoners, sex workers, and psychiatric patients, ranging from age 10 to 72, were intentionally exposed to STDs during the study. Syphilis exposure occurred through inoculation of the cervix in sex workers; through injection or direct sexual contact with infected sex workers in prisoners; and through injection, inoculation (via abrasion) of the penis, cisternal puncture (the insertion of a needle below the occipital bone at the back of the skull to access cerebrospinal fluid), or oral ingestion in psychiatric patients. Exposure to gonorrhea was carried out in sex workers through cervical inoculation and in Guatemalan soldiers through sexual contact with the sex workers and sometimes through urethral inoculation. https://www.britannica.com/event/Guatemala-syphilis-experiment (http://archive.is/8OmW9)

- Tuskegee syphilis experiment an infamous clinical study conducted between 1932 and 1972 by the U.S. Public Health Service. The purpose of this study was to observe the natural progression of untreated syphilis in rural African-American men in Alabama under the guise of receiving free health care from the United States government. The Public Health Service started working on this study in 1932 in collaboration with Tuskegee University, a historically black college in Alabama. Investigators enrolled in the study a total of 622 impoverished, African-American sharecroppers from Macon County, Alabama. Of these men, 431 had previously contracted syphilis before the study began, and 169[3] did not have the disease. The men were given free medical care, meals, and free burial insurance for participating in the study. The men were told that the study was only going to last six months, but it actually lasted 40 years.[4] After funding for treatment was lost, the study was continued without informing the men that they would never be treated. None of the men infected were ever told that they had the disease, and none were treated with penicillin even after the antibiotic was proven to successfully treat syphilis. According to the Centers for Disease Control, the men were told that they were being treated for ""bad blood"", a colloquialism that described various conditions such as syphilis, anemia, and fatigue. ""Bad blood""—specifically the collection of illnesses the term included—was a leading cause of death within the southern African-American community.[4] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tuskegee_syphilis_experiment (http://archive.is/xGIQp)

**Political:**

- Operation Snow White was a criminal conspiracy by the Church of Scientology during the 1970s to purge unfavorable records about Scientology and its founder, L. Ron Hubbard. This project included a series of infiltrations into and thefts from 136 government agencies, foreign embassies and consulates, as well as private organizations critical of Scientology, carried out by Church members in more than 30 countries.[1] It was one of the largest infiltrations of the United States government in history,[2] with up to 5,000 covert agents.[3] This operation also exposed the Scientology plot 'Operation Freakout', because Operation Snow White was the case that initiated the U.S. government's investigation of the Church.[3] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Snow_White

- ""Between 1969 and 1973, the U.S. dropped half-a-million tons of bombs on Cambodia alone, killing at least 100,000 civilians. Given that Nixon had been elected on a promise to end the war in Vietnam, Kissinger believed that it wasn’t enough to place Menu in the category of 'top secret.' Absolute and total secrecy, especially from Congress, was a necessity. He had no doubt that Congress, crucial to the appropriation of funds needed to conduct specific military missions, would never approve a bombing campaign against a neutral country with which the United States wasn’t at war."" https://www.salon.com/2015/11/10/henry_kissingers_genocidal_legacy_partner/ (http://archive.is/4NMTE)

- The CIA infiltrated the presidential campaign of Barry Goldwater on behalf of President Lyndon Johnson. They obtained copies of speeches and other material from the Goldwater campaign and gave them to President Johnson so he could respond to the points made before he read his speeches. CIA officer E. Howard Hunt was in charge of the spying operation. Hunt later retired from the CIA in 1970 and was hired by the White House in 1972 to lead a unit known as the Plumbers that was dedicated to plugging leaks within the Nixon administration, playing dirty tricks on Nixon’s opponents and obtaining political intelligence. https://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2018/05/22/cia-fbi-spy-presidential-campaign-trump-goldwater-218415

**The Government's influence in TV shows and movies:**

- Washington DC’s role behind the scenes in Hollywood goes deeper than you think. ""On television, we found more than 1,100 titles received Pentagon backing – 900 of them since 2005, from ‘Flight 93’ to ‘Ice Road Truckers’ and ‘Army Wives.' Between 1911 and 2017, more than 800 feature films received support from the US Government’s Department of Defence (DoD), a significantly higher figure than previous estimates indicate. These included blockbuster franchises such as Transformers, Iron Man, and The Terminator. http://www.independent.co.uk/voices/hollywood-cia-washington-dc-films-fbi-24-intervening-close-relationship-a7918191.html (http://archive.is/bbMwx)

-  Over the decades, the relationship between Hollywood and the military has served the needs of both sides: Filmmakers gain access to equipment, locations, personnel and information that lend their productions authenticity, while the armed forces get some measure of control over how they're depicted. That's important not just for recruiting but also for guiding the behavior of current troops and appealing to the U.S. taxpayers who foot the bills. National CineMedia, which sells ads in movie theaters, paired the Army and 20th Century Fox for a marketing campaign designed to reach potential recruits. The campaign intercut footage from the Fox superhero movie ""X-Men: First Class"" with images of real soldiers as a voice-over intoned, ""Heroes — ordinary people who discover they can do extraordinary things."" The spots played in cinemas, and exit polls of 17- to 24-year-olds leaving the movie theater found that those who saw the ad were 25% more likely to say they would consider joining the Army. http://articles.latimes.com/2011/aug/21/entertainment/la-ca-military-movies-20110821 (http://archive.is/01L57)

- Back in the 1960s, a sugar industry executive wrote fat checks to a group of Harvard researchers so that they’d downplay the links between sugar and heart disease in a prominent medical journal—and the researchers did it, according to historical documents reported in the journal JAMA Internal Medicine. One of those Harvard researchers went on to become the head of nutrition at the United States Department of Agriculture, where he set the stage for the federal government’s current dietary guidelines. All in all, the corrupted researchers and skewed scientific literature successfully helped draw attention away from the health risks of sweets and shift the blame solely to fats—for nearly five decades. The low-fat, high-sugar diets that health experts subsequently encouraged are now seen as a main driver of the current obesity epidemic. http://arstechnica.com/science/2016/09/sugar-industry-bought-off-scientists-skewed-dietary-guidelines-for-decades/

A deeper look into the 83 tickers that halted with in the first minute of trading yesterday (1/24/2023). And whether or not the publicly available data (daily price range) supports that they even should or could have halted. (Part 2/2 because of character limit),2014,Superstonk,https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/10kug1e/a_deeper_look_into_the_83_tickers_that_halted/,1674637503.0,"[For those who missed it, here is part 1, I had to split it up because it was too long.  Part 1 goes into why I am looking at this, how I am looking at this, and some TLDR of patterns I found in the data below.  It also has the 35 more suspicious tickers as well as the 1 ticker that was just plain odd.](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/10kuekt/a_deeper_look_into_the_83_tickers_that_halted/)

Here is the rest of the  DD that I promised in [my post earlier](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/10kawf7/halt_tracking_guy_here_with_some_more_info_about/) looking into the extremely odd halt behavior across quite a few large cap stocks at market open yesterday/today (Tuesday Jan 24, 2023). This took a bit longer to write than expected, so the day that you are seeing this is likely not to be consistent between people or even within this post, whenever I say either ""Today"" or ""Yesterday"" I mean 1/24/2023.

Now, I am going to list off all of the tickers that were halted during the ""glitch"" and give some more data about them.  Some company or ticker names have been shortened for formatting, but the tickers are all there if you want to cross check.  During the first 15 minutes of trading, a large cap company needs a movement of +/-10% or more to halt (we are in this range), a smaller company needs +/-20% (pretty sure towel is in this range), and a penny stock needs +/-40%.  For all of my feasibility calculations for halts, I will default to assuming a +/-10% range unless I comment otherwise.

[For those who haven't seen my posts for the last 6 months, I have been tracking Limit Up Limit Down Halts market wide since the end of July](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/10iqp9a/pretty_calm_short_trading_week_in_terms_of_halts/) I have a few more important posts buried in the first bit of that post going back a bit further. [My first post on this topic was my analysis of every stock that had even a single LULD halt between Jan 27 and Jan 29 of 2021.](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/vcsnj2/an_analysis_of_every_stock_that_had_an_luld_halt/) I figured at the time that I might be able to find other tickers possibly in the swap basket.

A big issue that I have started to run into with all of my posts recently is just the honestly quite large task of converting my excel spreadsheets into a digestible format, and if any apes have skills in web development and would like to help me make a website that automatically scrapes data from a couple other websites and then compiles it into a readable format automatically that would be greatly appreciated.

Ok, I think that gets all of the intro out of the way, let's get into the data now

First, let's get into the more simple facts of what happened and was recorded on [the NYSE halt tracking page](https://www.nyse.com/trade-halt-current)

1. There were 78 different tickers that all halted at exactly 09:30:15 EST (15 seconds after market open)
2. there were another 5 tickers that halted in the first minute of trading, the first ticker to halt later than 09:30:15 was swapcorn, which halted at 09:30:16
3. LULD halts will almost always be either exactly 5 or 10 minutes long (based on my data going back to August 2019), out of the 83 tickers that halted in the first minute of trading, only 10 of them had an even 5 or 10 minute duration, the remaining 73 tickers had seemingly random durations, mostly between 5 and 10 minutes, but quite a few were longer than 10 minutes.

[here is the excel spreadsheet that I used in case anyone wants to check it. Column's A-H are a copy and paste from the .csv off the NYSE halt page, but sorted according to start time. Column K subtracts the start time from the end time in order to determine the duration of the halt, Column L checks that the start and end dates match (not an issue here, but I have seen it before). Column O is a manual entry of the market cap of that company from yahoo finance, and column Q is a manual entry of the country where the company is headquartered.](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1mPhtLJUH9TjonJux1MAwKAzusCY5ILwB/edit?usp=share_link&ouid=104304488697756019170&rtpof=true&sd=true)

I manually calculated maximum percentages for each ticker based on the daily price range from yahoo finance using the following equations

* Maximum upward movement percentage= 100\*(Highest price of the day -Lowest price of the day)/Lowest price of the day
* Maximum downward movement percentage = 100\*(Lowest price of the day-Highest price of the day)/Highest price of the day

These equations will always return a smaller absolute percentage for downward movement for downward movement than for upward movement because the denominator in the downward movement is always going to be higher than the denominator of the upward movement. Also, this is literally the largest percentage that could have happened if the entire day's action happened in the first minute of trading, it is likely that the companies didn't actually hit the percentages posted in the first minute, but they could not have possibly get higher percentages than reported here.

Now to summarize what is in the remainder of this post

1. Oil and Gas was the most common type of company to show up (16 out of 83 halts in the first minute were on companies in that area
2. Financial companies were tied with Oil and Gas (also 16 out of 83 halts)
3. The combined market cap of all the companies that were halted in the first minute of trading was 6.23 Trillion dollars
4. 69 (heh, nice) out of the 83 companies are based in the US, but the other 14 were spread across the UK (3) Taiwan (1), Canada (3), Switzerland (2), Chile (1), Denmark (1), Japan (1), China (1) and Ireland (1)
5. A considerable number of the tickers (35/83) either would have had to go from their lowest price of the day to the highest price of the day, or literally could not have halted in either direction because there isn't a large enough difference in the reported numbers on yahoo
6. There was a single company out of the 83 where both of the percentage calculations returned very even fractions (1/2 and 1/3, no rounding on either) which just seemed super odd. Additionally, I am pretty sure I remember some talk on the OG sub after the sneeze about that company, also they literally develop software for the more shadowy 3 letter agencies in the US government so there is also that...

OK, so here are all the tickers that halted during the glitch, that probably shouldn't have halted based on their price ranges over the entire trading day. The rest of the tickers are in part 2 of this post

All of the following are formatted as follows

* ""Company Name (ticker) - Sector/Industry - country of headquarters - data about today's movements and company market cap""

Verizon (VZ) - telecommunications - US - halt started at 09:30:15, and lasted 8 minutes and 8 seconds.  According to yahoo finance, it closed yesterday at $39.63, opened today at $38.69, and had a range between $32.76 and $44.73, but neither of the prices in that range show up on the actual ticker on the site.  If these were within 5 minutes of each other they are either a movement of -27% or +37%, either of which would have triggered a LULD halt (halt bands at that time would have been +/-10%).  The current market cap of Verizon as of 01/20 was 167.99 Billion.

AT&T (T) - telecommunications - US - halt started at 09:30:15, and lasted 7 minutes and 49 seconds.  According to yahoo finance, it closed yesterday at $19.10, opened today at $18.97, and had a range between $15.15 and $22.84, again neither price in the range show up on the actual ticker, but they are far enough apart to have triggered a LULD halt in either direction.  The current market cap of AT&T as of 01/20 was 137.05 Billion.

Raytheon Technologies Corporation (RTX) - US - Aerospace/defense - halt started at 09:30:15 and lasted 9 minutes and 17 seconds.  According to yahoo finance, it closed yesterday at $96.25, opened today at $108.84 and had a daily range between $94.02 and $108.84 (opening price).  A halt in either direction would have been feasible with this range (+15.76% or -13.62%).  The current market cap of RTX is  138.71 Billion as of 01/20.

The Mosaic Company (MOS) - Basic Materials (agriculture) - US - halt started at 09:30:15 and lasted 13 minutes and 33 seconds.  According to yahoo finance, it closed yesterday at $48.35, opened today at $47.75, and had a daily range between $42.30 and $50.40 although neither of those show up on the chart.  A halt in either direction would have been feasible with this range ( +19.15% or -16.07%).  The current market cap of MOS is 16.35 Billion as of 01/20.

Wells Fargo & Co. (WFC) - financial services (bank) - US - halt started at 09:30:15 and lasted 12 minutes and 10 seconds.  According to yahoo finance, it closed yesterday at $45.03, opened today at $44.91, and had a daily range between $40.01 and $45.20, although the chart doesn't show any prices below around $44.50.  A halt in either direction would have been feasible with this range (+12.97% or -11.48%).  The current market cap of this ticker is 163.84 Billion as of 01/20.

Wells Fargo & Co. Depositary Shares, each representing a 1/1000th interest in a share of Non-Cumulative Perpetual Class A Preferred Stock, Series D (WFC PRD) - same as previous - US - halt started at 09:30:15 and lasted 16 minutes and 27 seconds.  I am pretty sure that this stock is listed as WFC-PD on yahoo finance, the range for that ticker on yahoo finance was a close yesterday of $19.21, open today at $23.32 and a full range of $19.08 and $23.32 (open price).  A halt in either direction would have been feasible with this range (+22.22% or -18.18%).  The current market cap of this ticker is not available on yahoo finance.

PPL Corporation (PPL) - Utilities (regulated electric) - US - halt started at 09:30:15 and lasted 12 minutes and 25 seconds.  According to yahoo finance, it closed yesterday at $29.32, opened today at $29.18, and had a full range of $24.89 to $29.56.  The lower price is not even remotely shown on the ticker.  A halt in either direction would have been feasible with this range (+18.76% or -15.80%).  The current market cap of this ticker was 18.67 Billion as of 09/30/2022 (the most recent market cap is not available).

Union Pacific Corp. (UNP) - Railroads - US - halt started at 09:30:15 and lasted 9 minutes and 30 seconds.  According to yahoo finance, it closed yesterday at $210.13, opened today at $223.44 and had a daily range between $201.00 and $235.20.  A halt in either direction would have been feasible with this range (+17.01% or -14.54%).  The current market cap of this ticker was 128.28 Billion as of 1/20.

Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Companty Ltd. (TSM) - Taiwan - technology (semiconductors) - halt started at 09:30:15 and lasted 10 minutes and 52 seconds.  According to yahoo finance, it closed yesterday at $95.66, opened today at $98.00 and had a range between $93.81 and $106.43, although there don't appear to be any prices above $95 on the ticker.  A halt in either direction would have been feasible with this range (+13.45% or -11.86%).  The current market cap of this ticker was 429.48 Billion as of 1/20.

Newmont Corporation (NEM) - Basic materials (metal mining, primarily gold) - US - halt started at 09:30:15 and lasted 13 minutes and 23 seconds.  According to yahoo finance, it closed yesterday at $53.63, opened today at $51.12 and had a daily range of $53.04 to $60.08, again, the opening price isn't in the reported range.  The reported range would allow for a halt in either direction (+13.27% or -11.72%), but the reported opening price would raise those to (+17.53% or 14.91%).  The current market cap of this ticker was 42.34 Billion as of 1/20.

Transocean LTD. (RIG) - Energy (oil/gas) - Switzerland - halt started at 09:30:15 and lasted 7 minutes and 2 seconds.  According to yahoo finance, it closed yesterday at $6.23, opened today at $5.59 and had a daily range of $5.50 to $6.31 which does include the opening price.  The reported range would allow for a halt in either direction (+14.70% or 12.84%).  The current market cap of this ticker was 4.34 Billion as of 1/20.

PETROLEO BRASILEIRO S.A.-PETROBRAS ADS (PBR) - Energy (Oil/Gas) - Chile - halt started at 09:30:15 and lasted 10 minutes and 6 seconds.  According to yahoo finance, it closed yesterday at $11.73, opened today at $14.46 and had a daily range between $10.59 and $12, which doesn't include the opening price so something is probably off there.  The reported range would allow for a halt in either direction (+13.31% or -11.75%), however using the opening price increases both of those drastically to (+36.54% or -26.76%).  The current market cap of this ticker was 71.54 Billion as of 1/20.

Magellan Midstream Partners, L.P. (MMP) - Energy (Oil/Gas) - US - halt started at 09:30:15 and lasted exactly 5 minutes (first one on this list with a normal duration). According to yahoo finance, it closed yesterday at $54.07 and opened today at $60.55.  The reported daily range was $52.00 to $60.55 (open), but the visual ticker doesn't show prices much above $54.  The reported range would allow for halts in either direction (+16.44% or - 14.12%).  The current market cap of this ticker was 10.86 Billion as of 1/20.  This ticker had a normal duration, and announced a dividend before market open, so it is possible this is a legitimate halt, however the fact that the actual price range isn't visible on the ticker makes me a bit suspicious still.

Valero Energy Corporation (VLO) - Energy (Oil/gas) - US - halt started at 09:30:15 and lasted 10 minutes and 15 seconds.  According to yahoo finance, it closed yesterday at $143.08, opened today at $146.56, and had a daily range between $141.85 and $160.16, even though it visually doesn't look like it got close to $140 and definitely doesn't look like it even broke $150 let alone $160 on the chart.  The reported range would allow for a halt (+12.91% or -11.43%).  The market cap of this ticker was 55.03 Billion as of 1/20.

QuantumScape Corporation (QS) - Consumer Cyclical (lithium batteries for cars) - US - halt started at 09:30:15 and lasted 9 minutes and 6 seconds.  According to yahoo finance, it closed yesterday at $8.26, opened today at $8.10, and had a daily range between $6.49 and $8.31.  The daily range would allow for a halt in either direction even if it is in the +/-20% category (+28.04% or -21.90%).  The market cap of this ticker was 3.37 Billion as of 1/20.  The first ""article"" on yahoo news is 5 days old and is explicitly warning against a short squeeze play, so this could be worth a second look.

Altria Group Inc. (MO) - Tobacco - US - halt started at 09:30:15 and lasted 7 minutes and 35 seconds.  According to yahoo finance, it closed yesterday at $44.81, opened today at $42.72 and had a daily range between $44.72 (open) and $51.57.  The daily range would allow for a halt in either direction (+15.09% or -13.11%).  The market cap of this ticker was $80.54 Billion as of 1/21.

McDonald's Corporation (MCD) - Resturaunt - US - halt started at 09:30:15 and lasted 10 minutes and 12 seconds.  According to yahoo finance, it closed yesterday at $269.29 and opened at $236.77, with a daily range between $236.77 (open) and $270.16.  The daily range would allow for a halt in either direction (+14.10% or -12.36%).  the market cap of this ticker was 196.71 Billion as of 1/21.

MP Materials Corp. (MP) - rare earth element mining - US - Halt started at 09:30:15 and lasted 6 minutes and 41 seconds.  According to yahoo finance, it closed yesterday at $30.78, opened today at $30.65, and had a daily range between $27.31 and $30.65 (open).  The daily range would allow for a halt in either direction (+12.23% or -10.90%).  The market cap of this ticker was 5.36 Billion as of 1/20.

Western Alliance Bancorporation (WAL) - Financial Services (Bank) - US - halt started at 09:30:15 and lasted 13 minutes and 32 seconds.  The closing price yesterday was $67.79, the opening price was $61.31, the official range from yahoo was $61.31 (open) to $68.72.  This range would allow for a halt in either direction (+12.09% or -10.78%).  This ticker had a market cap of 7.22 Billion as of 1/19.

Shifting away from Europe, we turn to China once more, where Hunan is put in the spotlight with its existing content getting a complete overhaul, featuring a new narrative with many new characters. This is accompanied by some smaller changes to Fengtian, Mongolia, Shanxi, and Yunnan, as well as some other broader Chinese updates.

And across the Pacific, we are also giving some overdue attention to Central America, with several small tweaks to the content of its constituent countries, and most notably with a revamp of socialist Centroamerica. As expected, this larger, non-save compatible update also includes many other small additions and fixes that we’ve been working on. We hope you enjoy 1.1.4!

Note: As a reminder, both Player-Led Peace Conferences and the State Transfer Tool have already been integrated directly into Kaiserreich and can be accessed via the Game Rules menu before starting a game. We occasionally get reports of people running into bugs while having the separate versions of these submods running, so this is just to make sure you are all aware that you don’t need separate mods for either any more, and haven't needed them for over two years!

Or get a serious revamp. For the past two decades they, along with whomever they have clung to in government in order to stay in power, have driven industry and output in this country to its knees. And it doesn't look like they're going to change that.

Moreover, they also refuse to adopt proven systems and technologies that have been adopted elsewhere in Europe with huge success, almost because of a vendetta against industry in the country.

My opinion is that they need to no longer be in power, or undergo such a reformation that they would essentially be a brand new party.

**ADDENDUM (VERY LONG):**

I had expected that this post would provide a fairly mixed bag of results with regards to people's responses, but I did not expect to see such a large volume of comments. As I cannot hope to respond to every comment, either the ones directed towards me, or as part of ongoing conversations in this thread, I will instead address as many as I can in this addition to my original post (I am sure this will be a long one).

Honestly I am glad this sub-reddit is so active, it means a (relatively) civil discourse can be achieved. I have always found text-based discussions to be lacking, as there is little room for clearing points of discussion - and often things devolve quickly. This is true in any space online. When it comes to providing evidence for my claims and opinions, I will get to that in this addendum to my post.

However, even once I provide them, I do not expect many people's opinions will change, either towards the links I provide here, or towards me personally for this post. There is so much misinformation everywhere, especially in modern broadcasted media that it is difficult to trust most sources. I have criticised some in this thread for providing ""evidence"" in the form of journalistic articles and news pieces. I stand by that criticism. I have called others foolish or naïve for failing to see how punitive measures don't work as intended, I do not apologise for that. I expect as much intelligence from a person as they proclaim to have, and certainly as much intelligence as I have (I am by no means a genius, but I do have experience and knowledge).

I do believe it is foolish to expect punitive measures to be successful in a society as free and democratic as Ireland's is. We have a remarkably strong constitution and a great many civil liberties, even compared to other wealthy western states. My comments and opinions on the Green Party and their actions come from my belief that their views of the world as it is are not only poorly founded, but their solutions to those problems are equally poorly founded. When I say ""they need to go"", I am NOT suggesting a purge of any kind. We are a democracy, I whole-heartedly believe the voting booth is our greatest political tool as citizens, as well as tools such as this forum where we can openly voice our opinions.

So - here are some of the citations, sources and articles that (I hope) will alleviate some of your worries or claims that I don't know what I am talking about, or that I am wrong about all of it:

**1)** One of my primary claims is that the Greens do not implement or support proven technologies that do help to alleviate the emissions and environmental impact of agricultural activity, chief among these is anaerobic digestor plants. There are only a handful in the Republic, despite there being over 100 such facilities in the North. France in particular has seen massive success with these. See here [https://www.iea.org/countries/france](https://www.iea.org/countries/france) and here [https://www.biogasworld.com/news/biogas-biomethane-market-france/](https://www.biogasworld.com/news/biogas-biomethane-market-france/) And they are continuing to implement them on a large scale. They reduce the reliance on oil and coal, and other fossil fuels sources, as well as alleviate the amount of waste dumped back into the environment. There are many cross-sectoral benefits to these. The Greens here however, claim to support their implementation, but regularly denounce them when asked about them. See here [https://www.greenparty.ie/green-partys-hackett-warns-of-anaerobic-pitfalls/](https://www.greenparty.ie/green-partys-hackett-warns-of-anaerobic-pitfalls/) and here [https://gortbiogas.home.blog/2021/02/12/galway-green-party-opposes-gort-biogas-proposal/](https://gortbiogas.home.blog/2021/02/12/galway-green-party-opposes-gort-biogas-proposal/) for just some examples, there are more. I have worked as an engineer for a company in Cork that designs and builds these plants, so I know what I am saying when Ms Hackett and her party either don't understand the benefits of AD plants (or for that matter how they work), or simply reject them as a viable solution to some of Ireland's environmental issues caused by agriculture.

**2)** Another of my claims is that the Greens do not do enough with off-shore wind power development. My eyes were on the west coast when mentioning this, and to my shame I actually had very little knowledge of the development and works being done on the east coast in this field. Truthfully, the slow pace and poor funding for these projects can be said to be more of a failing of the Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael governments than that of the Green party themselves - however, I stand by my claim that off-shore is worth the short term cost in favour of the long term benefit when compared to on-shore wind farms. After all, when considering the health of the environment, surely the ONLY goals that should matter are the long term ones. My reasons for not supporting on-shore wind development are fairly straightforward.

They kill birds, granted a very small amount, under 100 per year in Ireland. But I would imagine a better number would be zero. The area and number of turbines required to establish large enough farms to produce viable power supply is incredible - the largest in the Republic being the Galway Wind Farm, which has 58 turbines, none larger than 3MW. That's quite small. Ireland's total wind power generation average's out at 32% in the year, but can fluctuate from near zero all the way up to 45% depending on weather. See here [https://windenergyireland.com/about-wind/facts-stats](https://windenergyireland.com/about-wind/facts-stats) This makes it impossible to rely solely on it as an energy source. However, off-shore wind turbines can easily be made twice as large, and larger than on-shore turbines, and with greater capacity for expansion since there are no residents to upset. See here for current projects in the works [https://www.trade.gov/market-intelligence/ireland-offshore-wind-plans#:\~:text=Ireland's%202019%20Climate%20Action%20Plan,from%20renewable%20sources%20by%202030](https://www.trade.gov/market-intelligence/ireland-offshore-wind-plans#:~:text=Ireland's%202019%20Climate%20Action%20Plan,from%20renewable%20sources%20by%202030). This makes much more sense to pursue. The area on land should be used for reforestation and afforestation, if the goal is to make Ireland carbon-neutral AND more biodiverse. But as it stands, the Greens and the rest of the government do not seem to consider this, or for that matter the concerns of locals when establishing these on-shore farms.

**3)** This next paragraph will be about forestation and carbon sinks, since many in my comments seem to believe I don't understand how this works. I do, believe me. The Green party in Ireland have been adamant that we need a greater proportion of land dedicated to carbon sinks to alleviate the large carbon output of our country. That's fine, it's great even. However the Greens, the EPA and Teagasc neglect a great deal of the carbon sinks that do exist in Ireland even as it stands, despite having the figures available. Irish grassland DOES act as a carbon sink, about 50% as effective as forested land would, but this is far from negligible. Irish grassland is very fertile, and very healthy compared to elsewhere in Europe, and more suited to this purpose as well. We also have proportionally far more than anywhere else in Europe. See here [https://www.ria.ie/sites/default/files/potential\_of\_irish\_grassland\_soils\_to\_sequeter\_atmosperic\_carbon.pdf](https://www.ria.ie/sites/default/files/potential_of_irish_grassland_soils_to_sequeter_atmosperic_carbon.pdf)

Next - Ireland has a huge proportion of land dedicated to hedgerows, approximately 272 kHa, with forested land covering just over 770 kHa. Hedgerows are NOT counted as part of Ireland's carbon sink capacity, due to ""cost"". See here [https://www.epa.ie/publications/research/climate-change/ccrp-32-for-webFINAL.pdf](https://www.epa.ie/publications/research/climate-change/ccrp-32-for-webFINAL.pdf) Despite the fact that all data so far indicates that hedgerows are almost exactly as effective as forests as carbon sinks. They also act as natural sanctuaries for over 200 species of indigenous animals. And who tends to these hedgerows and keeps them maintained? Believe it or not, over 50% of them are maintained by farmers, remember those evil old men who hate the environment?

**4)** Another of my claims is that industry in Ireland has been brought to its knees due to the Greens and their implementation of punitive tax measures, primarily aimed against the agricultural and manufacturing sectors in our economy. I am not stating they brought the WHOLE economy down for Christ's sake. But more and more farmers and private manufacturers are struggling each year due to increased costs due to CO2 and NO2 taxes, that affect them far more than any other group in Irish society. One commenter in this thread seems to believe that a carbon tax is supposed to be a punishment against polluters - that's not how our society works. We are not fascists here. We don't punish our citizens with tax. Carbon tax is supposed to be used to fund alternatives - but the alternatives are nowhere near as readily available to rural communities as they are to urban ones. And it's not like the rural communities in Ireland are small either - over 30% of Irish people are rural. See here [https://www.cso.ie/en/releasesandpublications/ep/p-urli/urbanandrurallifeinireland2019/introduction/](https://www.cso.ie/en/releasesandpublications/ep/p-urli/urbanandrurallifeinireland2019/introduction/)

Is the solution to move all of these people in ghettos outside Dublin with yet more urban sprawl? What will they do for work? Where will they be housed and how? Once all carbon has been removed from Ireland's system what will the tax system look like then? It was pointed out to me that Ireland's gross GDP only relies on agriculture for approximately 6%, 38% on industry and the remainder on services. But here's the devilish thing with statistics - they tell the story YOU want them to tell.

Agriculture directly provides 7% of employment in the country, but it also supports certain aspects of industry and services, namely manufacturing and distribution. It also believe it or not, allows people to do something they all need to do - EAT. See here [https://www.statista.com/statistics/375575/ireland-gdp-distribution-across-economic-sectors/#statisticContainer](https://www.statista.com/statistics/375575/ireland-gdp-distribution-across-economic-sectors/#statisticContainer) here [https://www.cso.ie/en/releasesandpublications/ep/p-syi/statisticalyearbookofireland2020/econ/nationalaccounts/](https://www.cso.ie/en/releasesandpublications/ep/p-syi/statisticalyearbookofireland2020/econ/nationalaccounts/) and here [https://www.teagasc.ie/rural-economy/rural-economy/agri-food-business/agriculture-in-ireland/](https://www.teagasc.ie/rural-economy/rural-economy/agri-food-business/agriculture-in-ireland/)

Which sounds like a more environmentally sustainable option - to eliminate agricultural industry and production on our green island and out source it to South America and New Zealand, or to use our own produce and make export profit through trade? Even regardless of the economy, this isn't a better solution, because the food is going to have to come from somewhere. And shipping it half way across the world using the most environmentally damaging mode of transport ever created (shipping) hardly seems like a responsible way of going about it. But with the Green party, in conjunction with the rest of government, all we see is more and more and more taxes placed on people who have no alternatives. And it WILL lead to imported food at some stage, even though Ireland has immense capacity for food independence. I'm sorry, but this has to stop. This is why the Greens need to be voted out of government, because their solutions always amount to hardship for more and more people each year.

I know this was a very lengthy addendum, but if any of you care to read through it, and carefully read through the links I posted - as requested - then I hope you'll see I'm not blindly attacking one group out of spite or hate. I want the Greens gone because they simply don't get their stated goals completed, and even worse, they would see the country fail on the road to their own goals failing.

It is likely I will not respond to too many more comments in this thread. But I will be keeping an eye on it as it does matter to me, and I do want to keep my finger on the pulse as much as I can. The last thing I want is to do is get stuck in an echo-chamber of my peers.

Capitalist famines. The case of Ireland and how its famine was objectively caused by capitalist economic policy,36,CapitalismVSocialism,https://www.reddit.com/r/CapitalismVSocialism/comments/1dhxyh9/capitalist_famines_the_case_of_ireland_and_how/,1718630579.0,"Particularly astute people will realise a post was made on a different sub identical to this a few years ago. That's because I wrote it, so I'm copying it here :3

We often hear about how ""Communism = no food"" with the citations of famines like in 1921 of '32. There are countless posts that have been made on these famines, but instead of adding to the pile I wish to focus on something new. Namely, how famines have been exacerbated by Capitalist and free market policies. Namely by looking at the role of the Free Market in the Irish famine of the mid 19th Century. But first, some

**Background:**

Ireland was not a region that was always governed by the English. British plantations in Ireland had existed for centuries but their dominance was not wholly unquestioned or unchallenged as native ownership of land was still very much dominant and Protestant plantations owned approximately 40% of the land in Ireland by the 17th Century

With the defeat of Charles I in the English Civil War by Parliament's forces Ireland was once again subjugated. However, due to the Catholic royalism within Ireland the forces of Oliver Cromwell conquered Ireland and harshly repressed the population. After Cromwell's victory, huge areas of land were confiscated and the Irish Catholics were banished to the lands of Connacht. The Long Parliament had passed the Adventurers Act in 1640, which stated that those who lent money to Parliament for the subjugation of Ireland would be paid in confiscated land. Parliamentarian soldiers who served in Ireland were entitled to an allotment of confiscated land there, as a replacement for their wages, which the Parliament was unable to pay in full. As a result, many thousands of New Model Army veterans were settled in Ireland. By the end of the confiscation of native land during the Commonwealth period, Catholic landownership had fallen to 8%.

These actions led to the deaths of hundreds of thousands of native Irish during the conquest via repression and led to a dominant Protestant land-owning and inevitably, capitalist class.

**The Potato Famine of 1845-52:**

The Potato Famine was without a doubt the most brutal famine in Irish history and the history of the British Isles. It led to the deaths of more than 1 million people1, With the most severely affected areas in the west and south of Ireland, where the Irish language was dominant, the start of an Irish Diaspora in the Americas as 2.1 million people left Ireland to the USA which in total led to the loss of around 25% of the Irish population, a demographic shift that Ireland has yet to recover from.

So what caused the famine? Well, the famine was caused mainly by an outbreak of potato-blight, potatoes were encouraged to be used by landowners and by the 1800's the crop was heavily relied on by the entirety of the nation. The potato was also used extensively as a fodder crop for livestock immediately prior to the famine. Approximately 33% of production, amounting to 5,000,000 short tons (4,500,000 t), was normally used in this way.2 So with the arrival of the blight, obviously tragedy would arrive? Well... yes. Obviously. But attributing the excesses of the famine merely to blight hides much of the exacerbation of the famines.

As I am sure many are aware, Britain did block aid from arriving. For example, when the Sultan of the Ottoman Empire offered to send £10,000 (around £1,243,440.86 when adjusted for inflation) it was declined as the Queen had only sent a 1/10th of that amount. But racism against the Irish natives and royal pride were not the only reasons for this. While Ireland did send representatives to Parliament, it was hardly representative of their population. In fact, Between 1832 and 1859, 70% of Irish representatives were landowners or the sons of landowners.3 Hardly people who had the interests of the Native Irish in mind. Why is this? Because reports into Ireland by the British consistently found and proved that living conditions in Ireland were abysmal.

""...between 1801 and 1845, there had been 114 commissions and 61 special committees enquiring into the state of Ireland, and that ""without exception their findings prophesied disaster; Ireland was on the verge of starvation, her population rapidly increasing, three-quarters of her labourers unemployed, housing conditions appalling and the standard of living unbelievably low"".4

Legislation to fix these issues would inevitably require the reform of the standards that landlords and plantation owners were subjecting their workers to. But of course, as 70% of Irish representatives were landowners this had become impossible.

Therefore, we can say that Capitalism had led to the creation of a land-owning class which had vested interests in blocking any potential of fixing the situation as doing so would have hit them in their pockets due to a need for better living and housing conditions that they would need to provide.

**More issues caused by landowners:**

During the 1700's, the ""middleman system"" for managing landed property was brought into Ireland. The middleman system was constituted by leaving rent collection to the hands of the landlords' agents also known as middlemen. This assured the landlord of a regular income, and relieved them of direct responsibility, while leaving tenants open to exploitation by the middlemen.4

The middlemen rented large amounts of land on various estates and sub-divided the land into smaller holdings which were later rented to poor Catholic farmers. As they kept sub-dividing estates into smaller and smaller parcels they increased the rent every year in a practice known as rack-renting.5

The average tenant farmer lived at a subsistence level on less than ten acres. These Catholic farmers were usually considered tenants-at-will and could be evicted on short notice at the whim of the landlord, his agent, or middleman. By law, any improvements they made, such as building a stone house, became the property of the landlord. Thus there was never any incentive to improve their living conditions.5

Alongside this, many landlords did not even live in Ireland (these were known as absentee landlords) thus, the profits they made which were collected from ""impoverished tenants"" who were paid minimal wages to raise crops and livestock for exports6 was mostly sent to England7. In affect, this drained wealth from Ireland, the profits that otherwise would have went back into Ireland (in at least some shape) instead went straight into England. The only exception to this was in the Ulster area, where (alongside there being a dominant Protestant population) bills known as ""Land rights"" were in affect, which compensated tenants for any improvements they make. An investigation into the standards of Ulster concluded that:

""...the superior prosperity and tranquillity of Ulster, compared with the rest of Ireland, were due to tenant right "" 4

Therefore, we can say that landlords and renters held such power and dominance over Irish tenants and Irish representation that the idea of policy which benefited the native Catholic population (whereas Ulster was dominated by Protestants) made any attempt at relief or reform next to impossible. It was these Capitalist policies of landlords and an aversion of direct intervention by the government which made Ireland so vulnerable.

It is now worth going back and considering some other titbits of information about the role of landlords in creating horrid living conditions and the famine. Earlier I mentioned that the root cause of the famine was Potato blight due to the dependence on the crop by Irish farmers. This may sound like an issue independent of Capitalism and landlords, but there is more going on here than meets the eye! The holdings of Irish tenants were so small that no crop other than potatoes would suffice to feed a family. Before the famine, the British government reported that poverty was so widespread that one-third of all Irish small holdings could not support the tenant families after rent was paid; the families survived only by earnings as seasonal migrant labour in England and Scotland.8

2/3rds of people (around 5 million people) depended on agriculture for their survival due to the plantation system, but rarely received a working wage. They had to work for their landlords in return for the patch of land they needed to grow enough food for their own families. This vicious circle forced Ireland's peasantry into reliance on one crop, since only potatoes could be grown in sufficient quantity to meet nutritional needs.6

This is very important to note as it means that it was the interests and actions of landlords and the Capitalist class were THE reason Ireland relied on the Potato. They did not only exacerbate the famine. Their actions directly lead to it.

So now we have seen how Capitalism via plantations and landlords led to the famine starting. But what about the government response which we only briefly looked at? Well...

**The Tory Response:**

The Tories were in charge of Ireland at the start of the famine and, truth be told, did try to send aid, however, the aid that was sent (£100,000 of maize and cornmeal) were foodstuffs that needed Mills and cooking in order to properly eat. But the few Irish mills in operation were not equipped for milling maize and a long and complicated milling process had to be adopted before the meal could be distributed.

Alongside this, there was considerable protest at the act, as people were concerned that government action would stifle private enterprise in the region. Moves to alleviate the famine was met by opposition because some people feared it may possibly hinder Capitalism somewhat. Which is telling enough on it's own, but hey. At least some aid (as half hearted as it may have been) was sent, right? Sure. But the blunders did not stop there. In October 1845, there were moves to repeal the Corn Laws—tariffs on grain which kept the price of bread high. However, this act of government intervention also proved controversial and would not pass until next year, where it did little to help. (admittedly, some may make the argument that as these were tariffs and therefore protectionist policy it is a fault more of a specific type of Capitalism where free trade and Lassez-faire policy would work better, however...).

**The Whig Party:**

The Tory party soon lost power due to various reasons, chief among them the failure to respond to famine. The new Whig administration, influenced by the doctrine of laissez-faire4, believed that the market would provide the food needed. They refused to interfere with the movement of food to England, and even halted the previous government's food and relief works, leaving many hundreds of thousands of people without access to work, money, or food9.

Charles Trevelyan, who was in charge of the administration of government relief, limited the Government's food aid programme because of a firm belief in laissez-faire Capitalist policies4.

By the time the worst year of the famine was over, the Whig party had realised that its policies had failed. The Whig's had then decided to implement reforms such as Soup kitchens and Irish Poor Laws. However, The costs of the Poor Law fell primarily on the local landlords, many then attempted to reduce their liability by evicting their tenants, inevitably damming them to die of starvation10.

Furthermore, the Poor laws suffered many more failings. Chief among them was ""The Gregory Clause"" which stated that anyone who held at least ​1⁄4 of an acre would not receive relief10. This meant that, if a farmer, having sold all his produce to pay rent and taxes, should be reduced, as many thousands of them were, to applying for public outdoor relief, he would not get it until he had first delivered up all his land to the landlord. These factors combined to drive thousands of people off the land: 90,000 in 1849, and 104,000 in 1850(10).

In 1849 the Encumbered Estates Act allowed landlord estates to be auctioned off if creditors wished. Wealthy British speculators purchased the lands and ""took a harsh view"" of the tenant farmers who continued renting. The rents were raised and tenants evicted to create large cattle grazing pastures. Between 1849 and 1854, some 50,000 families were evicted.(11) (12)

**Conclusion:**

There is much more that can be said on the Irish famine, such as the continuation of exports by the British government, but it is clear that the dominance of the Capitalist plantation class and the landlords (which in total evicted around 250,000 people)13 in order to maximise their profits and the Capitalist policies of the Whig party led to the creation of one of the worst tragedies of human history.

Next week u/infininme will lead us through Part 3 Absence.

**Chapter 7**

Violeta met Fabian Schmitt - Engler, a veterinarian, son of German immigrants who had prospered.  After instantly falling in love with Violeta, he persisted in trying to win her over; visiting daily, then eventually gaining the trust of Uncle Bruno and Fecunda with his dullness.

Violeta's aunts told him their family stories, which included many disasters, including the decapitation of her grandmother in a car accident.  They never discussed her father or the reason for their exile.  They were invited to the Schmitt- Engler's hotel for lunch, and despite her obvious poverty, Violeta passed inspection, even though Fabian's family would have preferred a German girl. Fabian proposed in the Birdcage, taking Violeta by surprise. She was fond of him, yet he annoyed her.  In an out of character move, he kissed her passionately and she felt a sexual awakening.  Many meetings in the Birdcage ensued with Fabian insisting on them remaining dressed.  Although he had won her aunts' approval, Violeta still didn't feel any great attachment to him.  She wanted a taste of freedom before settling down.

**Chapter 8**

Jose Antonio changed his name to Delvalle, to cut ties with the past, and signed official documents for the partnership with Marko Lusanovic.  With Marko's knowledge gained at the sawmill, and José Antonio's legal and administration skills, they developed the idea of prefabricated wooden houses.  The loan officer at the Regional Bank of Sacramento was so impressed, he requested a partnership, and the sawmill was saved.  Thus, Rustic Homes was born. At first the orders were for small basic homes, which they built in a few days.  When the market for middle class couples arrived, Violeta suggested beautifying the houses with a thatched roof.  The business grew and they employed an architect.  Although the Rivases wanted Violeta to become a teacher, she didn't really like children and so convinced José Antonio to hire her.

It was decided that Violeta would spend some time in Sacramento and a new wardrobe was prepared. Fabian handed her an envelope of money and an eloquently written  passionate love letter as she left on the train.  Lucinda encouraged her to travel alone, saying that she must make her own decisions, that you must take care of yourself in this world, words she never forgot. After working as assistant to José Antonio for a year, she was called home with her other brothers to say goodbye to her dying mother. She hardly recognised them.

Her mother had advanced emphysema, and they called for Yaima to come to ease the pain. Using her healing powers as a medicine woman, she eased Maria Gracia to the Other Side. She fed her potions, lit candles and chanted in her native language, all the while beating a drum. Violeta felt herself go in a trance during this ritual.  Her mother was now sleeping peacefully and died peacefully in the early morning hours.

Violeta felt an anger towards her mother for not loving her enough to form a close bond. One afternoon in the office she felt a chill and saw her mother standing by the door.  She called to tell her to stay, but she vanished.  After this, she cried out all the bitterness.

**Chapter 9**

Violeta's marriage was delayed by the mourning period, and the outbreak of WW2.  Veterinarians were not highly paid, but Fabian's father gave him some land and José Antonio offered to build them a house. The country remained neutral in the war, despite pressure to oppose the Axis powers, as they were vulnerable to sea invasion. The Schmidt - Englers, like the other Germans, were sympathetic to the Axis powers, but Fabian stayed silent.  The Rivases and José Antonio tried to indoctrinate her against Hitler and Fascism.  They were highly interested in the war, whereas Fabian was more interested in artificial insemination of cattle, for which he became famous.

Miss Taylor and Teresa Rivas lived together as lovers at a time when homosexuality was only accepted for aristocrats (who were discrete) or artists (who flaunted social norms anyway).  Teresa Rivas devoted herself full-time to the feminist cause, working for the rights of women with regard to voting, labour laws, protection from violence, the right to divorce and abortion; ideas that were so radical, she was often thrown in jail.

Their visits were eagerly anticipated, as they brought their progressive ideas. Violeta read the feminist material that Teresa brought, and she felt a mute rebelliousness against the idea of marriage.  Teresa warned her not to marry Fabian if she didn't want to.  Violeta couldn't see any sensible reason to call off the engagement and didn't want a life of spinsterhood.

They married in 1945 after a 5 year engagement.  Marko Kusanoric attended the wedding - he had a child to a young indigenous woman, and provided for him. The end of the war was celebrated but Fabian wasn't included due to the tensions between Axis and Allies supporters.

Sex with Fabian was satisfactory without the great passion she would later experience with another man. They honeymooned in Brazil.  José Antonio built their house as promised and Violeta got involved in the business of housing projects, securing land and permits.   When she lived in Sacramento, she took out loans, bought land and financed eight houses.  She made sure not to let her domestic  duties suffer, but her earning money offended Fabian.  Violeta felt that she'd inherited the ability to make money from her father, without his carelessness. Fabian was a faultless husband, they lived well in a lovely home, she was accepted into his family, and they were successful in their work.  She loved him, but was never in love with him.  He bored her with his predictability, his obsession with his cattle and his Aryan arrogance, fed by years of Nazi propaganda, however they all thought the European immigrants were superior so she couldn't criticise him for that.

There was so much racism in society - some members of government wanted to force the indigenous people into submission, or exterminate them.  They actively encouraged European immigration, to improve the race.  Those from Africa and Asia were impeded, Jewish and Arab people were not welcomed.

Fabian took his marriage vows seriously, whereas Violeta hadn't realised that ""until death do us part"" could be a very long time.  He reassured her when she politely questioned this, that she would feel satisfied when children arrived.  Unfortunately they didn't, which was a personal affront to Fabian, the reproduction expert.  Once he made a passing comment about artificial insemination in humans.  For the most part, Violeta successfully played the role of submissive wife, but after three years of marriage she left.

**Chapter 10**

Julián Bravo, a decorated pilot in the UK RAF, flew two members of the Danish Royal family into the country.  It was at the Hotel Bavaria, where they stayed, that Violeta met him.  She was attracted to his masculinity.  They felt a mutual certainty that they had been searching for each other.  Julian led her to the beach where a passionate affair started with an intense kiss.  He invited her to his room and they made passionate love where only walls separated them from Violeta's husband. Violeta had very limited understanding of her body - Julián was openly admirative of her in her nakedness.  She explained to Julian that there was no love that afternoon, just desire.  As well as being a top pilot and an extremely attractive man, he could also sing.  Violeta spent the night there, and Julián encouraged her to lie to Fabian, but she insisted on telling the truth.  Julián was a bit alarmed at this.

When Violeta told Fabian she wanted to annul the marriage, he refused; he took his marriage vows seriously.  Violeta moved in with her brother and she saq Julián as much as possible.

**Chapter 11**

After fairly careless lovemaking, Violeta became pregnant, and Julián was initially furious, feeling trapped.  Fabian, on hearing the news, still didn't agree to an annulment, and when Violeta told him he had to give her half the assets, he refused. He still loved her and was prepared to take on Julián's child. When Juan Martín Bravo Del Valle is born, Julian saw in him an opportunity to live life all over again through him.  They started to live like a normal family.  Aunt Pía stayed with them to receive cancer treatment, and loved holding the baby.

Nursing her baby didn't prevent the next pregnancy, and Julián insisted it would be the last.  Violeta managed the household bills; she was earning enough, and Fabian had taught her the need to be financially independent.

**Chapter 12**

Aunt Pía died, and Fabian turned up to the funeral.  He noticed the absence of Julián and Violeta explained that he was on a flight.  Aunt Pilar had planted the idea that he was a womaniser and gambler who destroyed Violeta's life, marriage and reputation.

Because Julián was such a seducer, Violeta felt proud that he'd chosen her. However she was rejected by certain circles, including the German community. During her second pregnancy, Julián started to lose interest.  He was disgusted by the changes in her body; it was only their son who kept him from leaving.  He was training him to be a man.  If Voleta warned him about his gambling or drinking, he became violent, sometimes physically.  Violeta was ashamed that she put up with it.

One day a young woman turned up, saying she was his girlfriend - she'd been told the same lies.  Violeta confronted Julián with rage; he said she had no right to be jealous.   He told her she's become fat, she's lost her looks, her femininity and her youth.  He said it was unreasonable to expect him to resist beautiful young women. He calmed down and said they would start over, as long as she went on a diet and has a sterilisation.  A caesarean was planned for her breech baby, and her tubes tied at the same time.

Miss Taylor came to stay, and José Antonio was still in love with her.  Juan Martin grew up to be a gentle boy, unlike his father, and was intelligent and sweet.  Julián accused Violeta of coddling him, and feared that she'd turn him into a homosexual.  Nieves, their daughter was born with her father's fearlessness and spirit, could sing beautifully, and was spoiled and selfish.  Violeta went on a strict diet and updated her wardrobe, which made Julián jealous.

They were now accepted as a couple, but they were still unable to enrol the kids in the Catholic school.   Although Theresa Rivas assured her that divorce would soon be available, Violeta felt she had more power and choice as a single woman. She was earning well with Rustic Homes.  Julián kept a second set of books and regularly went to Argentina on mysterious flights.   This set of books caused Violeta great anxiety because it was the ruin of her father - she knew it meant corrupt money and secret government plots.  He was employed by the Mafia, running liquor, drugs and girls to Cuba.  Violeta went on one trip with him and was given chips to play at the casino.  She was even invited to a party at President Batista's palace.

Violeta suggested to Julián that he buy another plane, just for tourists and businessmen.  She provided the finance, and Seagull Air was born.  They reached a truce in their relationship, but Violeta lived in fear of his outbursts and his criminal connections.  In 1958 [Fulgencio Batista](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fulgencio_Batista)  escaped from Cuba during the [Cuban Revolution](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cuban_Revolution).   Julián had made multiple trips to and from Miami transporting fugitives, money and Mafia members before the revolutionaries arrived.  Julián moved his base to Miami, but Violeta stayed in Sacramento, visiting regularly.  One time Juan Martin said for his birthday he'd like Violeta to leave his dad for good.

**Chapter 13**

The Rivas farm was Violeta's refuge, she paid the expenses for Teresa. Teresa had been locked up for supporting the Communist party and had lost her health.  She was slowly dying of lung cancer.  Juan thrived at Santa Clara, especially as it was away from his father, of whom he was scared.  Nieves however hated the farm and was outspoken and disrespectful.  The 1960 earthquake, the strongest ever registered, was devastating across the country.  The farmhouse caught fire and Nieves rescued Teresa from the flames.  She was only 10, and had the same heroic nature as her father.

Teresa didn't survive, and Amos Taylor returned to Ireland. She hoped  to find her family, but gave up.  José Antonio fetched her back, and on the ship he gave her a ring, which she kept, but said she was too old and sad to marry.  Violeta found out later that they had agreed to have a ""white marriage"", or a platonic bond.  They soon abandoned their plan to leave the union unconsummated.

Miss Taylor inherited the farm from Teresa, and José Antonio built a new house there.  After the earthquake there was high demand for prefabricated homes.  As inflation was soaring, Violeta bought gold, and was on the road to richness.

Fabian showed up at José Antonio's house seeking legal advice - a large agricultural community of German immigrants needed the services of a discreet lawyer.  José Antonio asked him if he'd thought about an annulment - he hadn't. A few years later, when he needed money to finance a lab, he sold the annulment to Violeta which she purchased with some of her gold.  She was now a single woman.","['1.

"As an Irish Anarchist from Belfast, I'm getting pretty sick of the PIRA fetishisation around these subs.",969,Anarchism,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anarchism/comments/gr65zb/as_an_irish_anarchist_from_belfast_im_getting/,1590528800.0,"Not that it should really matter, but let me first say that if there was a vote to reunify the island of Ireland tomorrow, I would vote to do so. Replacing one flag with another isn't the end goal by any means, but smaller governments are easier to ~~overthrow~~ uh, change...

That said, having lived through the tail end of The Troubles and lived with the effects that the conflict has had on my society (including a drastically elevated suicide rate, a depressing statistic that includes my own mother) every day of my life, it really bothers me to see the extent to which the Provisional IRA in particular (but violent Irish nationalists in general) are sometimes held up as heroic, anti-imperialist freedom fighters here, on /r/COMPLETEANARCHY and other anarchist subs.

Other than an opposition to the ghost of British imperialism, there is nothing about the violent republican movement during the 1969 - 1998 conflict that anarchists should exalt or wish to emulate, and much that we should actively condemn. I'll do my best to explain my reasoning across as many fronts as I can, sorry if it gets wordy...

**Removing those in power simply so that you can excerpt your own power is not a goal aligned with anarchist principles**. Was I happy to see British soldiers outside my school when I was a kid? Of course not, but was I looking forward the the day they would be replaced with armed IRA men? No.

From the opening of the PIRA's own induction and training manual:

>...the Army is the direct representative of the 1918 Dail Eireann Parliament, and that as such they are the legal and lawful government of the Irish Republic, which has the moral right to pass laws for, and to claim jurisdiction over the territory, air space, mineral resources, means of production, distribution and exchange and all of its people regardless of creed or loyalty.

Now, I know what you're going to say - after all,in the same document, they go on to claim:

>The I.R.A. promises a democratic and socialist state:  
>  
>A Government system which will give every individual the opportunity to partake in the decisions which will affect him or her: by decentralising political power to the smallest social unit practicable where we would all have the opportunity to wield political power both individually and collectively in the interests of ourselves and the nation as a whole. Socially and Economically we will enact a policy aimed at eradicating the Social Imperialism of today, by returning the ownership of the wealth of Ireland to the people of Ireland through a system of co-operativism, worker ownership, and control of the industry, Agriculture and the Fisheries.

But as anarchists, we should know to be deeply sceptical of any group that, on the one hand, claims complete and total authority while at the same time assuring us that they will give that authority up as soon as the war is won/ time is right/ pigs fly. It has never happened, and if we ever thought it would happen then we wouldn't be anarchists. **The fact that those with power will never give it up willingly or peacefully to the people is some Anarchism101 shit.**

**Secondly** to this, the PIRA did nothing to enact any sort of direct democracy or wealth redistribution in any of the areas under their control, in fact it was quite the opposite. I highly recommend Anna Burns' Booker Prize winning novel *Milkman* if you want to see what life in an IRA controlled neighbourhood was actually like.

And **thirdly**, the lofty ideal of decentralized power was quickly abandoned when it looked as though political power through representative democracy could be achieved. Sinn Fein (their political wing) sit in the legislature in both the north and south of Ireland and have given up any notion of the sort of radical soviet pipe-dream mentioned above. Meanwhile, questions regarding the unelected army council's involvement behind the scenes still haunts the party. As most of us knew all along, they simply wanted power for themselves.

&#x200B;

But, theory aside, **these meagre ends do not justify such horrific means.** Imperialism is bad, you don't have to tell me, I live here, but whether armed struggle against the state is justified or not is irrelevant - *terrorising your own community isn't*, regardless of whether you also happen to be engaged in an armed struggle against the state.

I imagine that many of you would chalk up the vast majority of the (conservatively estimated) 500+ IRA civilian casualties to collateral damage when they were attacking legitimate military targets. Unfortunately for those of us who have to live with the physical and mental scars of their campaign every day, we know that routinely was not the case.

As you read these few examples, imagine how you would feel if they were perpetrated by a state actor against innocent civilians, *because that’s what the PIRA aspired to be*. Imagine if the victims were your neighbours, friends and family - because that’s who they were to us.

And please, *fucking please* try and resist the urge to knee-jerk react “*but the Brits…*” I know all about the fucking Brits, they committed war crimes against my community, but so did the PIRA.

**On 21 July 1972**, the IRA detonated 20+ car bombs in Belfast. Each one was aimed at a civilian target, including a hotel, a train station, a bus depot and a sweet shop (candy store). 9 people were killed and 130 were injured, including *77 women and children*. This was not the collateral damage of an attack against soldiers or military infrastructure, it was a coordinated attack against the civilian infrastructure of the city. If I turn my head 90 degrees to the left, I can see the site on which the Brookvale Hotel once stood - deep in an Irish catholic residential area. The IRA later admitted that Insufficient warnings were given to authorities.

At the Cavehill road, about a 10 minute walk from where I now sit, Margaret O'Hare (37), a Catholic mother of seven children, died in her car. Her 11-year-old daughter was with her in the car and was badly injured. Catholic Brigid Murray (65) and Protestant teenager Stephen Parker (14) were also killed. Parker had spotted the bomb shortly before it exploded and was attempting to warn people when he was killed. His father, the Reverend Joseph Parker, *was only able to identify his son's body at the mortuary by the box of trick matches in his pocket, and the shirt and Scout belt he had been wearing.*

**On the 13th of November 1973**, a *mentally handicapped 15 year old boy* named Bernard Teggart died in hospital from a gunshot wound to the head after he was found lying near the old Floral Hall ballroom, at Bellevue Zoo in north Belfast. He had been abducted, tortured and murdered by the PIRA on suspicion of giving information to the authorities. His twin brother John had also been abducted and beaten. The boys’ father, Daniel, had been murdered by British soldiers in the Ballymurphy massacre of 1971.

**Thomas Niedermeyer** was a German industrialist with no stake in the conflict. He was kidnapped by the PIRA in December 1973 and beaten to death, after the IRA broke off negotiations for a prisoner exchange. His two young daughters witnessed the abduction. *They, and their mother, all later took their own lives.*

**On 24 October 1990,** the PIRA carried out a series of proxy-bomb attacks. In these particular cases, **three men deemed by the IRA to be ""collaborators"" were strapped into three vehicles armed with explosives** and forced to drive to three British military targets. However, unlike the earlier proxy bombings, **they were not given the chance to escape.** They were Patrick Gillespie, a working class Catholic whose only crime was taking a job as a cook in an army base in one of the most socially deprived areas of the UK. James McAvoy, a catholic pensioner, was allegedly targeted because he served RUC officers at his filling station. The identity of the 3rd man was not publicly revealed.

In October 2014 **Máiría Cahill** (great-niece of IRA chief of staff Joe Cahill) waived anonymity as a complainant in a sexual abuse case to tell of her claims of being **abused as a teenager by a Provisional IRA member and** allegations of being subjected to an IRA internal investigation which **forced her to confront her abuser.**  Between 1997 and 1998, she had been raped by an IRA member. *She was aged 16–17 during this period*. In October–November 1999 the IRA held an internal inquiry into the matter and in March 2000 she was forced to attend a face-to-face confrontation with the IRA member. The ""trial"" was inconclusive. In July 2000 Cahill learned that two other women in her extended family had also accused the same man of abuse and that the IRA had also interviewed them.

Cahill reported her allegations to the PSNI, leading to three prosecutions brought against the alleged rapist and those alleged to have been involved in the IRA inquiry. All charges were eventually dropped  after Ms Cahill withdrew her evidence in May 2014, citing her loss of confidence in the conduct of the prosecutions. The former Director of Public Prosecutions for England and Wales, Keir Starmer, was appointed to conduct a review of the Cahill cases. He found the Public Prosecution Service had failed all three victims.

In September 2018 the Northern Ireland Police Ombudsman released a statement saying its report held that in 2000, intelligence received by CID and Special Branch was that 'Martin Morris was abusing children and the IRA were investigating it.' The Chief Constable George Hamilton issued a public apology to Cahill, and the other two victims, as did Sinn Fein leader Mary Lou Mc Donald. Cahill called Mc Donald's approach ,'woeful and inadequate.'**In 2015, A second victim of an alleged IRA rapist came forward** to accuse the republican movement of covering up for his abuser. Paudie McGahon claims he was subjected to an IRA “kangaroo court.” He was 17 when a well-known IRA figure from Belfast raped him.

From strapping a pensioner to an actual ton of explosives, literally bombing a candy store and covering up for child rapists - None of these cartoonishly evil actions were necessary in the fight against British imperialism and should be universally condemned, especially by anarchists.

**Tl’dr**: fuck the brits, fuck the PIRA. No borders, no flags, no government.

#Summary

- **Chapter Eight - The Lure of Easy Money**
The Timor sea contains gas and oil reserves that account for (at the time of writing) more than ¾ of the GDP. The Timor Sea aka *tasi mane* (male sea) is a sacred place associated with a source of wealth. The oil wealth can be clearly seen in Dili. It has bought money, contentment, safety and an influx of people from the rural regions. However, it also comes with the potential for problems aka the '[resource curse](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resource_curse#:~:text=The%20resource%20curse%2C%20also%20known,than%20countries%20with%20fewer%20natural)'. 

Timor-Leste uses the US$ and the 1st government created a sovereign wealth fund, however investment in in country education, infrastructure, agriculture, developing exports other than oil and large cultural ceremonies expenditure suggest the resource curse it likely. Tourism is almost non-existent, but most importantly, spending is high and investment in the country is low. Timor-Leste even became in position to donate to other countries in their times of need. Unfortunately the Strategic Development Plan 2011-2030 for the country is incredibly ambitious, and plans to action it are sorely lacking. 

Timor-Leste generates its revenues not from taxes (even though there is a dangerous dependency on resource revenues), but from selling its own resources, namely oil. Ease of Doing Business from World Bank reported Timor-Leste 168 out of 183 [(which went to 181 out of 190 in 2019](https://tradingeconomics.com/east-timor/ease-of-doing-business), perpetuating issues.  

Outside of the Capital little has changed, and subsistence farming and poverty are rife. Politicians talk of international air links and high-speed internet when in the country no piped water, only 6-hours of electricity and little sanitation is a reality. Children suffer from malnutrition and malaria.

The electricity generation method chosen by the state was to use the outdated and highly polluting heavy oil generators. The project was poorly executed, long delayed and 3 x over budget.

Oil was already prospect back in the 1950s and 60s, and Baucau was abuzz with oilmen on the hunt after oil seepages from the ground were reported. Australians invested heavily waiting for the announcement that oil was found. The search was tough, and years passed with no big commercial discoveries. In 1974  Woodside discovered a large gas field between Timor-Leste and Australia (but closer to the former) known as Greater Sunrise. No gas has been extracted due to the contention over ownership of the area between Timor-Leste and Australia leading to strained relationships between the two countries and a no-man's-land called the Timor Gap. This in turn lead to Australia being less opposed to Indonesia's annexation of Timor-Leste than it should have been, and also to become the 1st country in 1978 to recognise said annexation. 

Later Timor-Leste and Australia eventually settled on 50/50 split of Greater Sunrise revenue. However, extracting the gas then became a point of contention between the 2 nations and continues to be so.

Peake claims Timor-Leste was the most resource-revenue-dependent country in the world. He also states reserves would run out in 2024 (spoiler alert...it did not). He speculates on how one day, in the not too distant future, the country's bank balance may be zero or worse well into the negative.

- **Chapter Nine - The Tropical Bakery School of International Capacity-Building**

The Tropical Bakery, located near the United Nations compound was frequented by the *malae* in town. A latte costing as much and more than many Timorese had to scrape by on day to day. Peake questions how much the expats in Timor-Leste are actually helping. At the time Timor-Leste was receiving some of the highest per-capita allocations of aid, and yet malnourishment was high with 49.9% of Timorese living below the poverty line of US$0.88/day. 

Millions of dollars is spent yearly on development projects in all forms from many countries that don't always succeed. Often the proposals are extensive and written in English so completely inaccessible to the target local department. Infact La'o Hamutuk (a Dili-based NGO) estimates that about 90% of development assistance never actually reaches the country. Peake recognises there have been some successess, but is very critical of both the mode of implementation and the high turn over of staff affecting productivity. He believes the international community has a responsibility to self-reflect in order to enact true progress. The International community blame the locals for their lack of success whilst sending positively inflated reports home. On the other hand the Timorese are unhappy with the International communities interference especially after the influx of oil money meant reliance on aid (for some of the Timorese at least) was drastically reduced. 

Peake praises some committed *malae* in Timor-Leste, such as Isa  Bradridge who ran Familia Hope orphanage in the hill town of Gleno, and Keryn Clarke who worked towards providing ready clean water access to 10% of the population. 

- **Chapter Ten - Far From Home** 
In Northern Ireland men from Timor-Leste work in meat processing plants in Dungannon and Portadown. They send money back to relatives who buy TVs and radios that blare late into the night. Northern Ireland and Timor-Leste share Catholicism, colonial histories and a split island with a history of conflict. 

In the Republic of Ireland, after watching *The Death of a Nation*, unemployed bus driver Tom Hyland felt motivated to do something. He single handedly embarassed the Irish government into changing its policy on Indonesia. Later he moved to Dili to teach English, and became Ireland's honorary consul receiving Timor-Leste's highest honours.

The Timorese community in NI started with one man. A Timorese butcher living in Portugal. After being recruited and moving to NI more of his country folk followed. Timorese people are entitled to a Portugese passport, and therefore free travel in other EU countries. There were 1000s of Timorese in NI and the UK at the time of printing. 

Peake visits Dungannon finding it run down and depressing he begins talking Tetun with one man who invites him back home. 11 men live in a 3 bedroom house shift-sharing the beds. Not all have been able to find employment yet. They get US$10 an hour and send much (minus the obscene 18% transfer fee) home. There's not much left to live on. They have tons of questions for Peake as he is the 1st Irish person they have ever really spoken with. Sadly they face a lot of racism and prejudice. The English speaking immigrants fare better, but a lot of men were permanently cold, isolated, lonely and depressed. Many turn to gambling, so much so that Tetun signs can be seen.

Peake meets Bernadette McAliskey a Irish civil rights leader, political activist and friend to the Timorese community in Northern Ireland. The Timorese politicians make many empty promises, but ultimately it is Bernadette's NGO that look after the growing Timorese community in Dungannon. 

- **Epilogue**
Peake returns to Timor-Leste and Taur Matan Ruak former chief of the army is running for head of state. Journalist Jose Belo has been helping him campaign. (He actually becomes [President and later Prime Minister](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taur_Matan_Ruak) ). Peake ends with wishing Timor-Leste all the best creating a state of their own. How successful have they been since the writing of this book? I guess I have a little more research still to do.

Who owned the land ,19,IsraelPalestine,https://www.reddit.com/r/IsraelPalestine/comments/1c82wln/who_owned_the_land/,1713548318.0,"Living in Ireland I've encountered many protests and called them into question, prior to world war 1 Palestine was part of an administrative district known as sanjack of and belonged to the viyaelet of Beirut. It was not a distinct country, under ottoman rule the Dhimmi was poor, crippled by ottoman tax they would till the land as lessee. We should remember that upon the arrival of the Jews of the first Bilu that King Abdullah 1 categorically stated if the cultured Europeans rejected the Jews who then are we to accept them. Restrictions on Jewshish land purchase and Immigration prior to 1880 impeded the Jews from escaping vicious pogroms that were happening in Russia and other parts of Europe. We should remember that violence against Jewish civilians were a product of Haj al Husseini the grand mufti of Jerusalem. Prior to supporting Hitlers final solution he insisted the Nebi Musa Riots. The Nakba was unjustified however it was a result of pent up frustration and anger. The claim to the Al Aqsa mosque is that Mohammed was transported to heaven, the Jews inhabited the land for 2500 years under the Kingdom of Israel, the return to Zion has dwelled in the mind of the Jews since their removal from the Babylonians. In my humble opinion Israel does have a right to exist, Israel under the mandate system the Transjordan was more than enough land for both parties. The UN partition plan plays a significant role in the ongoing conflict and makes it impossible for a two state solution.

Bilu Jews of the first alliyah understood that there were people in the land and taught Arabic in addition to teaching their children Arab ways to prevent any conflict. The looting of safed showed from the onset that the Arabs were never to allow Jews to inhabit. When we look at Mohammed’s interactions with the three Jewish tribes that ended violently, it is clear that he was not fond of the Jews who rejected his notion of being the final prophet. When the Jews arrived the Fellahin was destitute, infant mortality was high and the use of animals for agriculture was not productive. A correlation can be seen in the rise of Palestinian population with the arrival of Jewish hospitals, modern agricultural practices were introduced to all peoples. The notion of Dar al Islam promotes the idea that any land captured by the Muslims will permanently become Islamic land (even if all the natives are non-Muslims). How then would the Jews ever live in peace. After Israel needed occupation in the Gaza Strip in 2005 Hamas a terrorist organisation whose motto was chanted free Palestine from the river to the sea, ignorant people chant away ignoring the fact this is a call for genocide. Hitler and his apostles of evil mass scarred 6 out 9.5 million Jews in Europe, the grand mufti Haj Al Husseini was a supporter of the final solution and had the Nazis gone past Egypt who knows how many Jews would have been killed. ","['the last 2000 years of Occupation of our homeland from the kingdoms of Israel and Judea had been by 7 different Empires (Roman Empire 63 BCE/BC -324 CE/AD, [All BC/AD from here] Bizantium 324-638, Arab Caliphate 638-1099, Crusaders 1099-1291, Mamluks 1291-1517, Ottoman Empire 1517-1917, and British Empire 1917-1948.) Some of the empires especially in the earlier stages conquered and reconquered the area multiple times so this is a simplification easier to remember.\n\n jews had been the majority untill the great massacre and conversions of the 5th century The exile pogroms, massacres, and inequality the jews have faced in the land stayed consistent in one form or another until 1948.\n\nAs for who lived here the answer is a bit more complicated as I said until the 5th century jews were the majority, for around 100 years greek/Bizantine Christians became the majority. Untill the Arab conquest in 638 were they massacred a lot of people and became a majority. \n\nNo matter who controlled the area since the Bizantins The situation stayed practically the same throughout the centuries as the place was impoverished with the number of people never rising from 300,000 people untill the Ottoman Empire that wanted to assert its control of the area and encurreged immigration and shipped a large number of chechnian, bosnian and croatian slaves (among a few other ethnicities) to the area (along other areas in their empire they wanted to assert their control) and for the first time since the Roman empire The population of the area in 1514 was only 300,000 and had managed to increase. In 500 years the population only increased by a bit more than 200,000 people and all thanks to the Ottomans.\n\nNow, the jewish migration is very well known as it existed consistently since the end of the expulsionof the Romans in 135AD but had only reached it\'s known numbers in the 19th century with the industrial revolution as steam ships can start nass imitation in a way more efficient and effortable way. Jews started arriving and because of the strict ottoman laws were at first turned away as the Ottomans did not agree to sell lands to jews but as the ottoman empire got more desperate for money they agreed to sell the unusable swamplands to the jews.  \n\nYou might be confused as to what I mean by unusable swamplands but the sad fact about this land is that the reason no empire (since the Bizantins) never invested any money in this place is because 40% of the place was horrendous swamplands filled with Malaria and other diseases and 50% was the sumerian and Negev desserts which are the asian continuation of the Sahara desert (the sumerian technically is a separate desert but we are not going to go that deep the point is that it was unable to sustain a population) and only less than that 10% was arable land and it was mostly the 5 ancient Israelites (and one Roman) cities; Jerusalem, Zfat, Acre, Nazareth, Jerico and Jaffa (also bethlechem but it had a very small population compared to the other five) and the Roman city of Ceasaria. That was where more 98% of the population lived.\n\nThe jews in the 19th century mostly as a part of the Zionist movement managed to convince the Ottomans to sell the unusable lands in the swamplands for them to for the first time since biblical times! Try and make new settlements outside of the ancient cities. They suffered both from the harsh conditions and the constant Arab pogroms (or as they are called in this context Pra\'ot) on the settlements. But by the 1950s they managed to dry the swamps in the north. \n\nbut the emigration that is less known is of the more than 700,000 Arabs to the British mandate that is not talked about at all. If you will Search the British census in 1922 and you will see that it showed 521,000 Muslims (not just Arabs, muslims in general), 73,000 Christians, 83,000 jews among 10,000 other (everything else)\n\nin 1947, there were 1.4 M Arabs in the Mandate and a bit more than 600,000 jews\n\nWhy are these Arabs considered ""Native Palestinians"" while the jews are considered ""white colonizers"". It\'s one of the way too many double standards in this conflict.\n\nYou might think it\'s the industrial revolution, but the area wasn\'t industrialised until the 1950s and 1960s, and the population growth stayed the same until the British came\n\nEdit: I hope I explained it well although I did gloss over almost 800 years of history and the parts I did talk about are simplified but you would have to forgive me for it is late at night and I only have one functioning arm due to a bike crush I had so I will have to finish here but I will gladly answer any questions you might have in the morning.

What’s the problem with apprenticeships in this country!? ,53,AskIreland,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskIreland/comments/1cs0suf/whats_the_problem_with_apprenticeships_in_this/,1715714883.0,"This is going to be long, but seriously; what is the problem with apprenticeships in this country. 

I’m 22 years old and trying to get an apprenticeship. I moved to Aus at the end of Christmas and quickly found out without papers, you won’t get far. So I decided to come back and get something for myself, I don’t regret going or coming back because it showed me what I needed to do.

I was working in an agricultural machine manufacturing factory for just over 3 years in the paint shop. I started out prepping, cleaning sanding etc for just over 1 year before the painter offered to teach me and over the course of a few months slowly learning I was full time spraying for about 2 years. I really enjoyed this much more than welding and it’s what I wanted to do as a job.

Unfortunately you cannot get a qualification in spraying/paint application in Ireland without doing something like panel beating despite most countries a panel beater and a painter are generally different, I didn’t mind this because I’d learn more skills. 

I didn’t have experience painting cars or using water base paints because as I stated I was doing agricultural machinery, so my experience was with standard 2pac paints. But I really wanted to learn, so a vehicle body repair apprenticeship was naturally the way to go.

For the life of me, I could not find anywhere taking on apprentices for panel beating. It’s a completely dying trade. I spent ages and finally found a place and after doing a months trial I was let go because the garage only had one panel beater who was doing mostly mechanical work and there just wasn’t much panel beating happening and they didn’t want to hold me back, fair enough. I found another place after a long time but left because the boss treated me with absolutely no respect. Like I was his child. I’m a 22 year old man and he was shouting and roaring at me over the most ridiculous things. Like I couldn’t find a socket in the tool box because many lads use it and one must’ve misplaced it, he started roaring at me to “hurry the fuck up” and when I politely told him I don’t know where it is he says “ I didn’t fucking ask you if you could find it, I told you to go get it” when I finally found it somewhere it shouldn’t have been, I told him sorry one of the lads had thrown it somewhere and he told me “I didn’t have to mention that” and I just exclaimed the reason it took me so long and he told me “to stop giving back chat, learn to shut your mouth and fucking take it on the chin”. That infuriated me on top of other examples throughout my time there so I decided to leave, because I was not putting up with that bullshit for 4+ years.

After leaving, I was on the hunt again, not being able to find anywhere. Everywhere I went, it was the same shit, people asking me what experience I had etc, and I’m trying to come in as a phase one apprentice. I’ve had interviews in countless places and despite my industrial painting background, it was the same shit of them asking me how much experience I had as if they wanted a phase one apprentice to have years worth of experience. Everywhere I went it was the same thing of “okay send us your CV and we’ll get back to you” and then nothing. 

Everywhere I went, they all wanted years of experience as a phase one apprentice trying to learn. And when you actually get somewhere they treat you like absolute shit. No wonder nobody wants to do it anymore these days. Everyone wants you to be a fully qualified phase one apprentice. 

Not to mention the money. It’s about €240 a week as a phase one vehicle body repair. I don’t understand how companies should be allowed to pay you so little money. I understand a young teen just finished his JC or something but a 22 year old man who had bills/car to run etc they’re allowed to pay me well below minimum wage despite working 39 hours a week doing the exact same work as everyone else, I mean if you went into McDonald’s you’d make far more. They really should have something in place where if you reach a certain age you should at least be entitled to a liveable wage as a phase one.

After about 3 months of all the BS of a horrible manager and countless interviews I still cannot find anywhere, so I’ve officially given up trying to do what I wanted and have to try and find another apprenticeship. Probably in electrical because it’s what everyone seems to be doing, but even then I am still struggling to find anywhere. Because as per, everyone wants you to be a fully qualified phase one apprentice. It’s absolutely tiring, and I don’t know what to do, I feel like every step forward I try to take I’m knocked back too. Is there any point in even trying to get an apprenticeship at this rate, it makes me feel like I should’ve stayed in Australia. ","['[deleted]', 'I have a lot of sympathy for you OP. It\'s diabolical out there for young people. Trades are not up to scratch in Ireland; we have too insular of an economy and too small a population to have big trade schools, and since the big bang in 2007/2008 the Apprenticeship path has been completely blackened by middle Ireland, filling colleges and universities with people who ""ought"" to be doing apprenticeships and would have been doing trades 20/30 years earlier, the area needs enormous overhaul and cultural attitudes need to change toward young people taking on apprenticeships. \n\nThe amount of people out there your age graduating with worthless college degrees and diplomas is scary, so youre not alone in feeling lost; there is a humungous labor issue coming down the tracks. In 10/15 years we will\nhave no Irish blocklayers/plasterers/panel beaters or sprayers like you aspire, however we will have plenty of event managers, sports scientists, and arts degree holders.\n\nKeep looking - there are opportunities. Give it 5 years. If it isnt looking up by the time you hit the mid/late 20s, head for Aus again.

Kansas Jayhawks - Named for the gangs of abolitionists that fought off the dirty Missouri slave lovers. Pat Devlin stated, ""In Ireland a bird, which is called the Jayhawk, flies about after dark, seeking the roosts and nests of smaller birds, and not only robs nests of eggs, but frequently kills the birds.""

Texas Longhorns - Two students who edited and wrote for the school newspaper decided to call the team the Longhorns and it stuck.

Utah State Aggies - Aggies was a common nickname for Agricultural schools. Utah State just never bothered picking a better nickname

TCU Horned Frogs - They took the name from their yearbook, but a legend states that the name came from the fact that one year the football field was covered in the little lizards.

Colorado State Rams - The school used to be called Colorado Agricultural and Mechanical College. There was a school competition to name the mascot. Someone came up with the CAM Rams. They are no longer CAM, but they are still the Rams.

Virginia Cavaliers - Back in the English Civil War, the king lost his head for being a shitty king, and Oliver Cromwell took over. During this time, royalist loyalists were called Cavaliers. They took their name from the Cavalry, as much of these loyalists were rich hoity-toity horse riding types. Virginia held royalist sentiments, and thus was a Cavalier state, unlike some of the other more Puritan colonies. Anyway, a student in the 20s wrote a a fight song for a school competition called the, ""Cavalier Song."" He won the competition, and the name ended up sticking.

Oregon Ducks - Oregon was originally called the webfoots. This stems from a group of Massachusetts Fishermen who fought in the revolutionary war. These fishermen's descendants eventually settled in Oregon. A student contest in the 20s chose this nickname. Journalists just started calling them the ducks instead so it stuck.

McNeese State Cowboys - This one is hard, but I think it comes from the fact that a lot of the early students were Ranchers

Samford Bulldogs - Chosen by student poll. The alternative nickname was the Baptist Bears. They made a mistake.

Akron Zips - Chosen by student poll. Named after rubber boots named zippers that were popular with students at the time.

Saint Peter's Peacocks - In WWI, the school shut down, but re-opened in 1930. The Dean then named the mascot the Peacocks because they represent, ""resurrection and eternal life."" I'm dead serious, this dude mixed up Peacocks and Phoenixes.

Things have changed some, we now have unions and labour laws but it's still true that if you have money it is easier to make more money.\n\nAs anywhere you consider strategic resources such as coal and iron. Ireland broadly lacks this during the British imperial era.\n\nPopulation for the purposes of labour, taxation, the purchase of goods, military manpower (army/navy). This varies over time, but it is never not a factor.\n\nFood production is important, particularly when you consider the more industrialised island of great Britain. After the 1801 act of union industry largely fled Ireland for Britain, with only some remnants existing in Dublin and the North East. Instead of being a nation with a need to invest in her own industry Ireland was part of a nation with existing industry for further investment, so that was where the investment went. However these people needed to be fed, and that was the role of most of rural Ireland, to feed Britain's cities.\n\nWith a lack of industry in Ireland natural resources such as stone, clay, wood, flax etc outstripped local demand for the same, so these raw resources were shipped from Ireland to the UK's cities, as they were from the far flung parts of Britain and their empire, to be made into manufactured goods of various kinds.\n\nMy final note would be that after the famine the population of Belfast exploded, I think it almost reached half a million people in 1900 though I'd have to check. This large population allowed it to creat a large shipbuilding industry, which in turn supported other industries such as the linen industry.""]",0.1519355644355644,0.4572219447219447,1

Plus, I can convey more or less the same information just be explaining what I'm looking for in a different country. I feel this is still a bit long, but certainly not to the degree it was before)

For starters, I wanted to make it perfectly clear that I am not doing this based on some romanticized notion about living in another country. I do not think living outside of America is all puppy dogs and rainbows. I understand that everywhere has its problems and I am more than willing to put up with those problems, study the politics, history, social conventions, and languages of anywhere I would move to. You'll see me point out some cons of the countries I've researched and am considering as a place to possibly move to some day, but that doesn't mean I'm disqualifying them as a place to move to. I'm actually just putting them out there for discussion.

I am a 24 year old female with high-functioning autism. While leaving may not be an immediate option for me, I want to keep my mind open to leaving someday. What I'm looking for in a country is most importantly a more stable political environment with a multi-party system where we the people have a say in the vote for our leaders and laws. I want somewhere with more affordable healthcare, that is safe for women and LGBT, where police are better trained, and where I do not have to worry about the threat of gun violence. I am a progressive person and I do not want there to be a far-right or conservative power to the degree of which there is here.  And this is pretty niche...but I am a rat person more than I am a dog or cat person. If a country does not allow for pet rats then I have to exclude it.

I am currently in school for an associate's in graphic design. I know it is not very impressive. I wanted to be an EMT or study wildlife biology, zoology, conservation, or entomology, but for one reason or another was unable to. However, I plan on going back for one of these degrees in the future. My ideal plan would be to save money and then pursue a degree in another country and look for work, residency, and citizenship from there. I've done research into some countries and I'd appreciate some advice on if my options are realistic or not. Obviously, nobody has to read all of this. Just if you see the name of a place where you could offer insight, maybe read my thoughts about it and let me know if you can offer any advice.

1. **Norway** - Any of the countries in Scandanavia or the Nordic regions attracted me. They have by far the best politics. Exactly what I'm looking for and that is what is most important to me, so these places are my first choice. I also love the dark and the cold, and they have good internet. And if I am understanding the transfer of currency right, I would actually be gaining money by converting USD to NOK. Norway in particular sounded perfect to me, however, it also seems like the most difficult to move to. As a non EU-citizen, I would need a strong reason to live in Norway. Being a skilled worker seems to be the way to go, but I am not proficient worker in the fields that are in demand. There is no reason a Norwegian company would hire and sponsor me instead of a native. Instead, my plan was to get the necessary bachelor here in America, go to a school in Norway for my master's, get a job there, and apply for a residency permit then eventually, hopefully, citizenship. Sounds like a plan, but again it won't be easy at all. I do not know what my chances are of even being accepted into a school there. I also do not know if I'd ever be able to find a job there, especially if I want a sponsor. From what I've read, Norwegian companies are significantly less likely to hire non-Norweigians. There was a study that found companies actually went out of their way to not hire people who didn't have a Norweigian last name. It would be devastating to get my degree in Norway just to never wind up being able to live there, and having wasted my money and my time. I would plan, of course, to learn enough Norweigian to hold a conversation before ever applying for a college or job there. Would that help my chances of getting accepted to a school and/or getting a job there? If so, how proficient would I need to be? If not Norway, would Sweden or Denmark be a good option? I did do some research into them, and I understand that Sweden is easier to immigrate to as an American, but I am still a bit unfamiliar on just how much they differ from Norway. Also, and again this is niche as hell, can I get pet rats in Norway or any of these countries? I couldn't find information of it online.
2. **Germany** - Germany was the first country that I considered. Compared to Norway, it is easier to move there as an American and I believe that it is a good place to study biology. I am still a bit unfamiliar with German politics, but I know it's at least better than America. I keep to myself, recycle, I enjoy taking walks, and I love meat and cheese and crackers, so I believe given time I would fit in quite well. What honestly deterred me the most was the notoriously awful internet. I was surprised because the rest of Germany seems so developed, but their internet seems to be some of the worst in Europe. If it really is that bad then it's a dealbreaker. Aside from my career pursuits, my actual dream would be to animate and make comics out of my stories and post them online. I do not think I could maintain an online presence in in Germany if the internet is as bad as they say it is. It is also difficult to find housing in Germany. From what I understand a lot of their architecture is old and most people have to live in apartments with roommates. As much as I want to leave America, I have to be realistic and not try to go somewhere where I would not be able to afford a living space.
3. **Ireland** - As of now, this is my second choice to Norway, but there are some significant drawbacks. First of all, I do NOT want to part of the UK, so I am referring to the Republic of Ireland only. The way of life is very promising. I think that I at least have a better chance of being a biologist in Ireland than in Norway. Agriculture is a large part of their society, so perhaps I could find a field that relates to that somehow. I understand that Ireland has both public and private healthcare, however, without insurance for private healthcare it can be difficult to be seen by a doctor (albeit not to the same extreme as Canada, for example). As far as politics go, I'm still a bit wishy-washy on the subject, but it has a multi party system where the people vote for their leader and that is good enough for me. I am unsure on just how much of a stronghold religion has on things in Ireland, considering that they are predominantly catholic. Although, it seems to be a safe place for LGBT people. There are some things that concern me about Ireland, however. First is animal cruelty. I have read that, especially in rural places, there is a lot of animal cruelty. This is absolutely unacceptable to me and would singlehandedly stop me from moving there. The other thing is the housing crisis that Ireland is facing. Again, if I am understanding the transfer of currency correctly, I would actually be losing money by converting USD to Euro (although if I wanted/was able to move from Ireland to Norway, it would be easier, and the transfer to Euro to NOK would increase my savings). I would like to live in Ireland, but I don't know if I would reasonably be able to find and afford a house.
4. **Australia / Tasmania / New Zealand** - These would be fantastic places to go to for biology! I am extremely attracted to the ecology and animals of Australia. Frogs in the toilet? That's a good day for me. I am not scared of neither snakes nor spiders nor sharks. I am, however, afraid of drowning, so I probably would not go in the ocean. I also have an irrational phobia of jellyfish. I also get hot at anything over 70°f, so unless I'm in Tasmania where it snows sometimes, I'll probably suffer under the heat of the sun. There are some things that deterred me from these places, however. The first is that Australia is a two-party system, and worse, a monarchy. Although the politics are probably better than the US, I believe that these systems are a breeding ground for corruption, and I would be wary of any conservative or far-right movements there. They also do not actually vote for their governing leader, but rather they vote for the people who vote for the leader which is then certified by the monarch. This is a *terrible* system of government, in my opinion, but maybe it's not as bad as my fragile American mind has me worrying about and is worth it. Hopefully, anybody from/who has lived in Australia can enlighten me. New Zealand is a multi-party system and somewhere I definitely would go, but their new prime minister has made some conservative statements I am not pleased with, and there are not term limits for their PM the way there are for presidents in the US. But the deciding factor for me, and something that I absolutely *devastated* about when I learned of it - is that Australia does not allow people with autism to immigrate there! They have even deported autistic people! That is EGREGIOUS! ...But I may still have a slight chance. You see, technically it is not the diagnosis of autism itself that disqualifies you, it is if your autism would cost Australia tax dollars to give you care. If you can prove that you are high-functioning, do not require medical care, and can support yourself then they may just let you in (although I believe in New Zealand it is just banned altogether). In the cases where people were deported, it was also almost always those who got a new diagnosis or those who had autistic children. I am an adult, I have had my autism diagnosis for nearly all my life, I am high functioning, I do not require any medical care for my autism, and I can support myself. Could I still be denied immigration, even with all this, if I supply all the necessary documents and medical history, if I pass the physical health exam, and if I hire an immigration lawyer? Could they just deny me entry, or worse, deport me at any time once I'm there? Would I be discriminated against by the Australian people, primarily employers, for having Autism? Honestly, that on top of the two-party monarchy might make Australia just not worth it at all, but I'm still thinking about it...

I have also considered some other places... I considered Italy, but it would probably be as difficult to find a place to live there as it would be in Ireland. I am not crazy about the religious presence either, and the politics are a bit unstable from what I can tell. I've heard good things about Spain and Malta, but more research is needed into those places. If anyone has knowledge about those places please share.

If you have ANY insight or advice then PLEASE contribute! I am begging you!

","['>I did do some research into them, and I understand that Sweden is easier to immigrate to as an American.\n\nThe only ways into Sweden are:  \n\\* Student  \n\\* Work  \n\\* Partner/Relatioship  \n\\* Already having Citizenship\n\n- For Studies, I wrote a long post 2 weeks ago with links of how that would work. In short, you will have to pay International Tuition and show up front that you have enough money to sustain yourself. Saying ""I will work"" will not be enough. What would happen if you cannot pay rent because you didn\'t get a job while studying? Live as a homeless?  \n[https://www.reddit.com/r/IWantOut/comments/1apdmhe/comment/kq7793v/](https://www.reddit.com/r/IWantOut/comments/1apdmhe/comment/kq7793v/)  \nAlso keep in mind that if you get a Bachelors while the locals and EU members get Masters, it will be tough to claim that you are more useful to a company.. So you might have to do a Masters as well.\n\n- For Work, all jobs in the EU must be advertised to the full European Union for at least 10 days before a company can hire someone from abroad. You as a non-EU will need your Work permit sponsored, even if you studied in Sweden, something that EU Citizens do not. It can take months to get a Work Permit sorted while people from within the Union can move and start working the next day if needed. You need to be more qualified than any EU Citizen since if you are all equal candidates, why take you when there\'s so much extra work to get you into the country and get you a Work permit?  \nKeep in mind the new laws about minimum salary for Work Permits (currently at 80% of the Swedish median salary but will most likely bump up to 100% as there seem to be broad political agreement).\n\n- Partners need to show extended cohabitation. Don\'t have to be married but sham marriages are a thing and not something that Sweden want to encourage. There are Requirements that the Swede need to fulfil (large enough place to live, enough money left after housing costs, etc) and you will be locked to that person so if the relationship turns sour your presence in the country could be in jeopardy. It can also take months for these cases to even get a case worker to look at it.\n\nKeep in mind the political rumblings in Sweden. For example, in the most recent election (2022) the Sweden Democrats, a party with roots in the Neo-Nazi movement and that\'s very anti-immigration, got 20,5% of the votes nationwide. So keep in mind that every fifth Swede was willing to vote for such a party.   \nTime as a Student will not count towards Citizenship, only time working. There\'s also talk about extending time to Citizenship to 8 years (currently 5 years) and there are people who wait 2-4 years to even get a Case Worker to look at their Citizenship application. There is also talk about a Language- and a Civics test to even get Permanent Residence, but don\'t think there\'s any proposal in the Government yet but, by the time you would be eligable, it very much might.  \n[https://www.thelocal.se/20230908/sweden-launches-inquiry-into-tougher-citizenship-rules](https://www.thelocal.se/20230908/sweden-launches-inquiry-into-tougher-citizenship-rules)  \n[https://www.thelocal.se/20221014/how-does-swedens-new-government-want-to-change-migration-policy](https://www.thelocal.se/20221014/how-does-swedens-new-government-want-to-change-migration-policy)  \n[https://www.thelocal.se/20230911/what-we-know-so-far-about-swedens-new-citizenship-proposal](https://www.thelocal.se/20230911/what-we-know-so-far-about-swedens-new-citizenship-proposal)\n\nSo 3 years Bachelor, 2 years Masters, 8 years working, then another few years to actually get the Citizenship application looked at. You are looking at maybe 15 years until you can be a Swedish Citizen. And that is if everything goes smooth and as planned with no hickups.', 'Have you investigated the government immigration regulations for each country on your list, to ascertain whether or not you’ve a shot at immigration? Via family descent for example? Failing that, you need to offer a desirable, sought after skill. Get a degree by all means (a degree’s pretty much the minimum requirement for your settling abroad anyway, if you can’t claim citizenship),  but getting work upon graduating is quite another matter, and certainly not guaranteed. Much depends on the degree: what will you study? The high cost of university education abroad is your primary concern of course....how would you fund the course, as well as daily life in your chosen country? \n\nBottom line is you must assess fundamentals first, because emigration is rarely a choice as though from a menu, as the transaction starts at the other end, with you meeting requirements of the new country. Regulations surrounding immigration are not flexible, and individual histories or aspirations, needs or interests are not part of the process, unfortunately. You’re either eligible or you aren’t. You have to look like a useful, tax-paying prospective citizen, with a skill set that the country specifically needs. This is your mission!', 'If you really are dedicated to moving abroad to Europe you should pick a language to start learning and switch your degree to computer science.\n\n\nTech jobs are still the best way for an American without a EU passport to get into Europe (even in the current economic climate).']",0.09987276612276612,0.45716993241889514,1

**Imagine a Congress that actually looks like America. It's filled with nurses, farmers, engineers, waitresses, teachers, accountants, pastors, soldiers, stay-at-home-parents, and retirees. They are conservatives, liberals, and moderates from all parts of the country and all walks of life.**

Practically, a lottery is used to draw around 100 to 1000 people to form one house of Congress. Service is voluntary and for a fixed term. To alleviate the problem of [rational ignorance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rational_ignorance), chosen members could be trained by experts or even given an entire elite university education before service. Because of random sampling, a sortition Citizens' Assembly would have superior diversity in every conceivable dimension compared to any elected system. Sortition is also the ultimate method of creating a [proportionally representative](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proportional_representation) Congress. 

Real World Evidence
----------------------
I've made some claims, but how would democratic lotteries work in the real world? Fortunately, sortition activists have been experimenting with hundreds of [Citizens' Assemblies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Citizens%27_assembly) across the world. The decisions they have come to have been of high quality. For example:

 * The BC Columbia Citizens Assembly was tasked with designing a new electoral system to replace the old [first-past-the-post](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First-past-the-post_voting) (FPTP) system. The organizers brought in university experts. The organizers also allowed citizens, lobbyists, and interest groups to speak and lobby. Assembly members listened to all the sides, and they decided that the lobbyists were mostly bullshit, and they decided that even though the university experts had biases, they were more trustworthy. This assembly ultimately, nearly unanimously decided that Canada ought to switch to a [Single-Transferable-Vote](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_transferable_vote) style election system. They were also nearly unanimous in that they believed FPTP voting needed to be changed. This assembly demonstrates the ability of normal people to learn and make decisions on complex topics. 
 * In [Ireland](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Citizens%27_Assembly_\(Ireland\)), Citizen Assemblies were instrumental in the legalization of both gay marriage and abortion in a traditionally Catholic country. Ignorant politicians thought the People wouldn't be able to compromise on these moral issues, yet they certainly were, when you finally bothered to get them into a room together.
 * Recent 2019-2020 Citizen Assemblies in Ireland and [France](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Citizens_Convention_for_Climate) reached consensus on sweeping, broad reforms to fight climate change. In Ireland taxes on carbon and meat were broadly approved. In France the People decided to criminalize ""ecocide"", raise carbon taxes, and introduce regulations in transportation and agriculture. Liberal or conservative, left or right, near unanimous decisions were made on many of these proposals.


Comparing to Elections
---------------------------
This model of democracy stands in stark contrast with what all elections offer. All electoral methods are a system of choosing a ""natural aristocracy"" of societal elites. This truth has been observed by philosophers such as Aristotle since ancient Greek elections 2400 years ago. In other words, all elections are biased in favor of those with wealth, affluence, and power. 

Moreover, all voters, including you and me, are rationally ignorant. Almost none of us have the time nor resources to adequately monitor and manage our legislators. In the aggregate as voters, we vote ignorantly, oftentimes solely due to party affiliation or the name or gender of the candidate. We assume *somebody else* is doing the monitoring, and hopefully we'd read about it in the news. And indeed it is somebody else - marketers, advertisers, lobbyists, and special interests - who are paying huge sums of money to influence your opinion. Every election is a hope that we can refine this ignorance into competence. IN CONTRAST, in Citizens' Assemblies, normal citizens are given the time, resources, and education to become informed. Normal citizens are also given the opportunity to deliberate with one another to come to compromise. IN CONTRAST, politicians constantly refuse to compromise for fear of upsetting ignorant voters - voters who did not have the time nor opportunity to research the issues in depth. Our modern, shallow, ignorant management of politicians has led to an era of unprecedented polarization, deadlock, and government ineptitude.

Addressing Common Concerns
---------------------------------
The typical rebuttal towards sortition is that people are *stupid, unqualified, and cannot be trusted with power*. Or, people are ""sheep"" who would be misled by the experts. Unfortunately such opinions are formed without evidence and based on anecdotal ""common sense"". And it is surely true that ignorant people exist, who as individuals make foolish decisions. Yet the vast majority of Americans have no real experience with actual Citizens' Assemblies constructed by lottery. In the real world, normal people are keen to retain their power and sovereignty (and are therefore quite happy to push back against expert opinion), and they take their role as legislator seriously (based on Helene Landemore's observations on the French Climate Assembly). The empirical evidence, based on all the results of Citizen Assemblies and [deliberative polls](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deliberative_opinion_poll) performed in recent years, in my opinion is sufficiently compelling to suggest that Citizens' Assemblies are competent. The opposition does not yet take sortition seriously enough to offer any counter-evidence of substance. Unfortunately until sortition is given real power, we cannot know with certainty how well they would perform. 

The second concern is that normal citizens are not experts whereas elected politicians allegedly are experts. Yet in modern legislatures, no, politicians *are not* policy experts either. The sole expertise politicians qualify for is fundraising and giving speeches. Actual creation of law is typically handled by staff or outsourced to lobbyists. Random people actually have an advantage against elected politicians in that they don't need to waste time campaigning, and lottery would not select for power-seeking personalities. 

The third concern is with corruption. Yet sortition has a powerful advantage here as well. Corruption is already legalized in the form of campaign donations in exchange for friendly regulation or legislation. Local politicians also oftentimes shake down small businesses, demanding campaign donations or else be over-regulated. Sortition fully eliminates these legal forms of corruption. Finally sortition legislatures would be more likely to pass anti-corruption legislation, because they are not directly affected by it. Elected Congress is loath to regulate itself - who wants to screw themselves over? In contrast, because sortition assemblies serve finite terms, they can more easily pass legislation that affects *the next* assembly, not themselves. 


Strategy and Implementation
------------------------------
Implementation for current activists revolves around finding political wedge issues and giving politicians an ""out"" where they can use a Citizens' Assembly to make the hard decision that politicians are too incompetent to make themselves. This is what was done for example in Ireland. The use of a Citizens' Assembly can also potentially give a politician ""democratic credibility"", for example with Macron and the French Climate Assembly. Then, if these Citizen Assemblies get more popular, activists can push politicians to make a permanent citizen's body that would eventually take more and more powers away from the status quo legislature. A similar process has constructed a permanent advisory citizens' assembly in Belgium.

As far as the ultimate form sortition would take, I will list options from least to most extreme:

* The least extreme is the use of Citizen Assemblies in an advisory capacity for legislatures or referendums, in a process called ""Citizens Initiative Review"" (CIR). These CIR's are already implemented for example in Oregon. Here, citizens are drafted by lot to review ballot propositions and list pro's and con's of the proposals. 
* Many advocate for a two-house Congress, one elected and one randomly selected. This system attempts to balance the pro's and cons of both sortition and election.
* Rather than have citizens directly govern, random citizens can be used exclusively as intermediaries to elect and fire politicians as a sort of functional electoral college. The benefit here is that citizens have the time and resources to deploy a traditional hiring & managing procedure, rather than a marketing and campaigning procedure, to choose nominees. This also removes the typical criticism that you can't trust normal people to govern and write laws. 
* Most radically, multi-body sortition constructs checks and balances by creating several sortition bodies - one decides on what issues to tackle, one makes proposals, one decides on proposals, one selects the bureaucracy, etc, and completely eliminates elected office. 

-------------------

**TLDR: Selecting random people to become legislators might seem crazy to some people, but I think it's the best possible system of representation and democracy we can imagine. There's substantial empirical evidence to suggest that lottery-based legislatures are quite good at resolving politically polarized topics.**

[Early data](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.12447) from a group of scientists support the alarming discovery that a large number of forests did not, as a whole, sequester more carbon than they emitted into the atmosphere. Only the Congo rainforest remained a solid carbon sink. Finland’s boreal forests [stand as an example](https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2024/oct/15/finland-emissions-target-forests-peatlands-sinks-absorbing-carbon-aoe) of how an ecosystem can transform when it ceases to be a carbon sink. “[In the northern hemisphere, where you have more than half of CO2 uptake, we have seen a decline trend in absorption for eight years](https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2024/oct/14/nature-carbon-sink-collapse-global-heating-models-emissions-targets-evidence-aoe),” said one professor. The oceans have been absorbing 90% of this carbon, driving a shift in global water currents. This study also did not factor in the year’s wildfires. Scientists and policymakers believe that, since carbon absorption rates appear to be dropping, this would (if we were actually serious about the problem) require even more demanding & immediate cuts to emissions to mitigate this problem. 

A post-storm [review from Hurricane Helene](https://phys.org/news/2024-10-north-carolina-hurricane-destroyed-homes.html) found that many wells have been contaminated with *E. coli* and other bacteria—in addition to the widespread infrastructure destruction wrought by Helene. Some scientists are [worried about how British shipwrecks might contribute](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c0jp0qq07pvo) to pollution problems as their old sunken hulls eventually lose structural integrity. [Flooding](https://www.aa.com.tr/en/europe/heavy-rainfall-triggers-deadly-floods-in-italys-northern-regions/3366362) struck Liguria, killing at least one.

[NOAA says](https://phys.org/news/2024-10-la-nina-winter-weather.html) that “a weak La Niña event will develop this autumn and could last until March.” Another [study](https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/sciadv.adq0604) confirms that atmospheric rivers have shifted 6-10° farther north in the last 40 years, particularly during La Niña events.

A [study](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-024-08051-2) from *Nature* claims that marine heat waves often develop independent of surface phenomena, making them much more difficult to predict & track. The researchers found more correlation with deep sea eddies, which “can impact acidification, oxygen levels and nutrient concentrations in the ocean” as well as exchange heat.

Despite the IPCC prediction that a collapse of the [AMOC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlantic_meridional_overturning_circulation) is unlikely before 2100, [some scientists are concerned](https://www.sciencefocus.com/comment/atlantic-current-collapse) that it could potentially occur even before 2050. The AMOC is at its weakest in human history, and one professor believes an irreversible ‘salt feedback’ tipping point may be close at hand, which could result in unpredictable consequences. 

A [study](https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.2410294121) published a couple weeks ago in *PNAS* affirms that “compound drought-heatwaves” which especially damage soil quality, “exhibit higher frequencies, longer durations, greater severities, and faster growth rates than {previous compound drought-heatwaves} in all aspects from 1980 to 2023. They are undergoing a critical transition, with droughts replacing heatwaves as the primary constraint….Transformation of natural ecosystems, particularly forests and wetlands, to cropland as well as forest degradation substantially enhance the strength” of these global trends. 

A paywalled [study](https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.adl5889) posted last week in *Science* confirmed the obvious: “extratropical forest fire emissions have increased substantially under climate change” particularly in the far north of North America and Siberia. They confirmed that “the intensity and severity of fires is increasing in extratropical forests, which is consistent with fires affecting drier, more flammable stocks of vegetation fuels as the climate warms and as droughts become more frequent.” This suggests that these regions may not serve as potential future carbon sinks in the future, since the Arctic is warming faster than most of the rest of the planet. CO2 emissions in these regions have almost tripled since 2001. 

A [study](https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lanplh/article/PIIS2542-5196(24)00229-8/fulltext) in *The Lancet* surveyed 15,000+ Americans aged 16-25 on how serious a problem they believe climate change is, mental health problems, assigning responsibility for climate disasters, and strategies for addressing climate change. A supermajority of young Americans are concerned about our changing global weather and dying planet, and 76% believe the government is betraying future generations by the way they are acting now. 

>“Overall, 85.0% of respondents endorsed being at least moderately worried, and 57.9% very or extremely worried, about climate change and its impacts on people and the planet. 42.8% indicated an impact of climate change on self-reported mental health, and 38.3% indicated that their feelings about climate change negatively affect their daily life….as respondents across the political spectrum perceived the impact of a greater array of severe weather events in their area, their distress related to climate change and their desire and plans for action increased….More than half of respondents indicated that climate change is causing them to question whether the work they put into their education (59.5%) or their career, job, or vocation (57.9%) will matter, and to be hesitant to have children (52.3%). A minority of respondents reported that climate change will make their life better (17.9%).”

A recent study found that [dolphin breath contains microplastics](https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2024/oct/16/microplastics-found-in-dolphin-breath-for-first-time-study). 

A [study](https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1029/2024GL110575) in *Geophysical Research Letters* examined the effect of spreading diamond dust into the atmosphere, as part of a geoengineering plan to rapidly cool down the atmosphere. Diamond dust tested better than any of the other proposed particles, but sourcing the necessary 5M tons of diamonds would be prohibitively expensive. 

The Global Commission on the Economics of Water released a [219-page report](https://economicsofwater.watercommission.org/report/economics-of-water.pdf) about the water cycle, ecosystem sustainability, and the consequences of water mismanagement. You can read the [30-page Executive Summary report](https://economicsofwater.watercommission.org/report/executive-summary-economics-of-water.pdf) if you don’t have the time for the full thing, but only the long report has graphics. A failure to meaningfully respond to the global water crisis could endanger over half of the world’s food production by the year 2050.

>“The world faces a growing water disaster….Decades of collective mismanagement and undervaluation of water around the world have damaged our freshwater and land ecosystems and allowed for the continuing contamination of water resources….the degradation of freshwater ecosystems including the loss of moisture in the soil has become a driver of climate change and biodiversity loss. The result is more frequent and increasingly severe droughts, floods, heatwaves, and wildfires….more than half of the world’s food production are now in areas where total water storage is projected to decline….A stable supply of green water {‘water stored as soil moisture and in vegetation, which returns to the air through evaporation and transpiration’} in soils is crucial to sustaining the natural systems that absorb more than a quarter of the carbon dioxide emitted from fossil-fuel combustion….the approach to water infrastructure has also been short-term and reactive, leading to neglected assets, frequent service disruptions and leakage – culminating in higher long-term costs…” -selections from the executive summary

In bottled water, and in tap water, [PFAS chemicals have become more common and more concentrated](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acsestwater.4c00533) in samples around the world—so says a [study](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acsestwater.4c00533) from *ACS ES&T Water*. The concentrations in bottled water were particularly high in China. 

A [UK study](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0045653524024263) on PFAS in marine areas supports the idea that “sewage discharges” following flooding events greatly increases the amount of PFAS introduced into the sea and the water cycle. This is “a likely minimum of 100% increase in concentration {of PFAS}”, and, “globally, 80% of wastewater is released to aquatic ecosystems untreated.” Although “Wastewater treatment plants are not efficient at removing PFAS compounds and are thought to be a major source of these compounds to marine environments” anyway. Some experts believe some PFAS chemicals can last for decades, while others may persist for over a millennium. And, because “sewage sludge is also used extensively in the UK for agriculture with 87% of treated sludge being distributed to land for fertiliser,” this PFAS may be coming to a farm near you—forever.

Estimates of U.S. children affected by Long COVID sit [between 10-20%](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/long-covid-is-harming-too-many-kids/), according to one study. Difficulties with concentration and memory are the top symptoms among young children, while teenagers tend to suffer more from taste/smell problems, body aches, and low energy.

The UN says [August set **new global heat records**](https://www.dailysabah.com/life/environment/un-declares-global-red-alert-as-august-sets-new-heat-records), according to early data from the EU. This was the **hottest August** in recorded history, during [the **hottest summer** in human history](https://www.zmescience.com/science/news-science/congrats-you-just-lived-through-the-hottest-summer-in-history/), during the **hottest year** on record. Many countries, [like Spain](https://x.com/extremetemps/status/1831251608673333339), felt their hottest August ever.

An old Greek village [was revealed](https://phys.org/news/2024-09-sunken-village-emerges-greek-drought.html) for the first time in 30+ years, because much of a large reservoir’s water was diverted to Athens during their emergency Drought. Greece felt its [hottest June and July ever](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cz6xvwxjd1do) this year. Rising Mediterranean temperatures [are **threatening a sealife dieoff**](https://www.seashepherdglobal.org/latest-news/record-heat-med/). And the [Caspian Sea is drying](https://fpif.org/is-climate-change-sucking-the-caspian-sea-dry/) up. 

Relentless [**flooding** has blasted](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/global-health/climate-and-people/south-sudan-floods-climate-change/) refugee camps in South Sudan, where an abnormally heavy rainy season has washed out the land, seemingly permanently, leaving 140,000+ refugees stranded on a newly formed island. Twenty flights arrive daily to provision the survivors. “**My land is a river now…All my livelihood has been lost**,” one elderly man said, having seen all of his ~400 livestock killed in the disaster. The [economic impacts](https://reliefweb.int/report/south-sudan/south-sudan-economic-crisis-and-food-insecurity-dg-echo-un-ocha-fewsnet-echo-daily-flash-04-september-2024) of their oil industry’s breakdown, and currency crisis adds to the country’s desperation.

Scientists are looking closer at [**ultrafine particles** (UFPs) from wildfires](https://phys.org/news/2024-09-amazon-rainforest-secondary-ultrafine-particles.html), and the dangers they pose to human health. UFPs also contribute to storm clouds & strong rainfall. Another [study](https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1029/2024JF007725) in *JGR Earth Surface* found a 10x increase in California land erosion, due to wildfires, from 1984-2021. 

A [paywalled study](https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.adn6833) in *Science* determined that **45% of the earth’s surface is made up of “deserts, shrublands, grasslands, and savanna woodlands”** and affected by various degrees of **water scarcity**. Because these “drylands” release less moisture (and more heat) into the atmosphere, they also receive less rainfall, which contributes to feedback loops which dry these lands further. [Another study](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41612-024-00742-x), published in *npj climate and atmospheric science*, claims that El Niño’s effect in Central Asia’s precipitation levels is increasing, and has likely created (and will continue to lead to) heavier rainfalls in the region. And a [similar study](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-024-51422-6) in *Nature Communications* establishes that **tropical forests are experiencing drying and warming soil**—this “will intensify soil carbon losses and negatively impact carbon storage in tropical forests under climate change,” according to the lead researcher. Predictions indicate a longer dry season in the future. 

This phenomenon is already [at play in Brazil](https://www.theguardian.com/world/article/2024/sep/02/weather-tracker-extreme-heat-hits-brazil-fuelling-risk-of-wildfires), where **average temperatures for this part of the year are 5-10 °C hotter**. The [Pantanal still burns](https://www.japantimes.co.jp/news/2024/09/02/world/amazon-jungle-fires-brazil/), and thousands of wildfires burn across São Paulo state. In the last week, Brazilian wildfires have torn through over 590 square km—just over the size of Ibiza. This year, Brazil has already felt wildfires burn 83% more area than from January-August 2023. Over 160 municipalities across Brazil have declared a state of emergency, and many fires are still growing.

At least 16 people were slain by the storm in the Philippines, four in Vietnam, and two in China.

The EU released a [110-page report on “**the Future of EU Agriculture**”](https://agriculture.ec.europa.eu/document/download/171329ff-0f50-4fa5-946f-aea11032172e_en?filename=strategic-dialogue-report-2024_en.pdf), and it details a set of 10-15-year recommendations ironed out over 7 months of negotiations. There are no fancy graphics, just text.

>“**The triple crisis of climate change, pollution, and biodiversity loss represents the most imposing challenge of planetary scale**. To date, six out of nine planetary boundaries have been transgressed and global progress towards environmental and climate goals remains modest….Depleted and polluted soils are less fertile and food resistant, diminished in their ability to store both carbon and water. These developments pose a serious threat to people’s health and well-being, to food security and to society and the economy in general, especially to agriculture and food systems….With Europe as the fastest-warming continent, extreme weather events, ranging from heatwaves and droughts to foods and hailstorms, are becoming increasingly frequent. In some parts of Europe, water availability is already a severe problem….The increasingly frequent **“weaponisation” of food and strategic non-food agricultural products** such as energy, notably in the context of Russia’s war of aggression against Ukraine, has significantly strained the sector….” -selections from the Chapter 2 summary

Murmansk, Russia, set [new September heat records](https://thebarentsobserver.com/en/climate-crisis/2024/09/september-heat-record-murmansk) last week. Monthly records were [also set in Germany](https://x.com/MAnderson003/status/1831394584859177389), much [of Scandinavia](https://x.com/extremetemps/status/1831404880193581090), parts [of China](https://x.com/extremetemps/status/1830969846403867034), in [both Koreas](https://x.com/extremetemps/status/1831497578451763352), and [in Indonesia](https://x.com/extremetemps/status/1830946891091116350).

Nigeria’s [oil shortage worsens](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cn49d1zwz8wo)—and prices are rising. Colombia held a [**nationwide strike**](https://thecitypaperbogota.com/news/colombia-impacted-by-nationwide-transport-strike-over-diesel-price-hike/) over rising diesel prices. Similar [problems are developing in Egypt](https://archive.fo/r4d9k) over natural gas, with secondary effects on the economy. In August 2023, a high-ranking ex-official who was stationed in Egypt assured me that “Egypt will collapse within six years.” If true, they have fewer than 5 years left.

Some experts believe [**Long COVID is coming for us all**](https://www.ineteconomics.org/perspectives/blog/debilitating-a-generation-expert-warns-that-long-covid-may-eventually-affect-most-americans)—and it just might end up affecting most living people. 

>“People see gradual improvement in symptoms over time, but a plateau may occur 6-12 months post-infection, and **only 22% fully recover within a year**. Others remain stable or get worse….each additional infection a person gets does mounting cumulative damage to the immune system….They [the U.S. government] used the CDC, the WHO, and the HHS [Department of Health and Human Services] to amplify the message that the vaccine is all you need and you don’t need to worry about anything else….**Most people have had COVID three and a half times on average already**. After another four years of the same pattern, if we don’t change course, **most people in the U.S. will have some flavor of Long COVID** of one sort or another….The latest boosters/vaccines do offer SOME protection from catching the disease. And while it varies somewhat from variant to variant, that starts at about 60%, peaking 2 weeks after inoculation and lasts for about 4 months, and then after that declines at about 4% decrease in effectiveness per month thereafter….Each new variant, really it’s just a coin toss on how lethal it is….Now we also have to be concerned about the bird flu and the responses and mitigation efforts associated with that. Bird flu appears to have a very high death rate from infection, as high as 58%.” -excerpts from an interview with Dr. Phillip Alvelda

Hundreds of **polio vaccination** teams were deployed across Gaza, and total vaccinations are [closing in on **200,000**](https://www.theguardian.com/world/article/2024/sep/04/uns-gaza-polio-campaign-inoculates-189000-children-in-first-phase), preventing a potential large-scale outbreak. Several hundred thousand children still need vaccinations.

Moderna’s [mpox vaccination](https://archive.ph/mwv9J) is proving itself in early testing. In the DRC, [**childhood mpox cases have spiked 75x**](https://reliefweb.int/report/democratic-republic-congo/drc-child-mpox-cases-surge-75-fold-worst-hit-province-schools-restart-week) since the start of year. This was also the first week of school in the DRC. Over 45% of new mpox cases in August were in the war-ravaged South Kivu province, on the Rwanda & Burundi border (and bordering Tanzania across Lake Tanganyika). In Goma, a city of some 2M people, [“conditions necessary to prevent it from spreading in and around Goma are simply not in place.”](https://reliefweb.int/report/democratic-republic-congo/mpox-eastern-drc-just-another-challenge-amid-torrent-problems) The first [mpox vaccines have arrived](https://www.reuters.com/world/africa/first-batch-mpox-vaccine-doses-arrives-congo-2024-09-05/) in the DRC. 

A [study](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/acs.estlett.4c00525) published in *Environmental Science & Technology Letters* found that the PFAS chemical trifluoroacetate has been steadily accumulating in Danish groundwater for the past 60 years. Meanwhile, a *Nature* [study](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-024-07758-6) concluded that “**global plastic waste emissions {increase} at 52.1 million metric tonnes (Mt) per year** {according to 2020 figures}, with approximately 57% wt. and 43% wt. open burned and unburned debris, respectively. Littering is the largest emission source in the Global North, whereas uncollected waste is the dominant emissions source across the Global South.” The [**Top 5 plastic-burning cities**](https://archive.ph/yovQI) are, in descending order: Lagos (metro pop: 16M+) Nigeria, Delhi (metro pop: 33M+) India, Luanda (metro pop: 9.5M+) Angola, Moscow (metro pop: 12M+) Russia, and Cairo (metro pop: 22M+) Egypt. Roughly 19% of people worldwide live in a place where there are no government waste management services. 

A 15-page [WHO report on cholera](https://reliefweb.int/report/world/cholera-2023-who-enfrzh) in 2023 was published last week. It claims that the “cholera pandemic continued to surge, with 535,321 cases reported to WHO, up from 472,697 in 2022.” Although cholera worldwide has hit 4 or 5-year highs, new cases are far below 2017 or 2019 figures. “**The geographical distribution of cholera changed significantly** from 2022 to 2023, with a 32% decrease in cases reported from the Middle East and Asia, and a 125% increase in Africa….This is the first year that multiple countries have reported deaths from cholera which occurred outside of health facilities, known as ‘**community deaths**’.”

In the U.S., [manufacturing has contracted](https://archive.ph/Jlpkl) for 5 months in a row.

A Summary of President Cecil H. Underwood's Term (1961-1965) | Peacock-Shah Alternate Elections,27,Presidentialpoll,https://www.reddit.com/r/Presidentialpoll/comments/1f13ynn/a_summary_of_president_cecil_h_underwoods_term/,1724612394.0,"[Cecil H.

Secretary of the Military: Ira C. Eaker

Secretary of the Interior: Johnson Holy Rock

Secretary of Culture: Roy Acuff

The[ inaugural address of Cecil H. Underwood](https://www.reddit.com/r/Presidentialpoll/comments/1eqldwc/the_inaugural_address_of_president_cecil_h/) would break all precedent by announcing in the opening minutes in his presidency that Underwood was “*requesting the resignation of all federal officials who hold office by virtue of executive appointment, and whose tenure is subject to executive action*;” noting that not all employee resignations would be final and promising the thousands of terminated workers their full pension in addition to temporary family unemployment relief. Alongside the cancellation of hundreds of contracts from the Tugwell era and the announcement of a complete audit of the federal government, Underwood deemed his actions to be the only way to destroy the “*corrupt machine*” of the New State in direct assault on the Lindbergh order.

This shattering deviation from the careful hands of Presidents Houston, Luce, and Quesada marks the first direct assault on the fascist order begun by President Lindbergh. That which has not been abolished has been reorganized to remove fascist elements, such as Secretary of Culture Roy Acuff’s work to strip Lindbergh’s controversial National Youth Administration of its fascist chants and uniforms to instead orient it towards community involvement and job training. Underwood has worked to demolish the New State from the top down, dissolving agencies and unsuccessfully seeking congressional support to liquidate the Departments of Planning, Elections, and Culture, the first two of which have been effectively gutted while the third has been significantly stepped back.

To these ends, Underwood has organized a cabinet of luminaries and experts from across the coalition, with former Progressive House Leader Richard Nixon and Liberal economist Pierre Rinfret boldly guiding the State and Treasury Departments, while former Monsanto Chemical CEO Edgar Queeny would preside over the abolition of most of the Planning Department and work with Agriculture’s Henry Bellmon to inaugurate a new “rural-urban partnership” aimed at overhauling the Tugwell Administration’s attempts to depopulate poor rural areas. Postmaster General Osro Cobb, controversially serving concurrently as Chairman of the Progressive National Committee, has overseen a plurality of the mass firings.

Further, the Underwood Administration has been marked by a remarkable level of public engagement with the President. Having declared “*I do not propose to sit within the walls of this capitol building for four years; rather, I want to move often among the people and report regularly via the press, radio, and television*,” Underwood has begun weekly addresses over radio and television and held extensive personal press conferences, despite joining Secretary of State Nixon in heavy depredations upon the media. Further, Underwood has engaged with popular culture by appearing on popular shows such as those hosted by Johnny Carson and Ed Sullivan or [*To Tell The Truth*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GVRSJc2JF08)*,* while tapping two young journalists, Liberal Ray Price and arch-conservative Pat Buchanan, to serve as White House Press Secretaries. However, perhaps most prominent in Administration advisors has been the Reverend Billy Graham, whose Evangelical fervor has elevated him to status as a regular White House guest and President Underwood’s principal advisor on social and spiritual issues.

**Foreign Policy:**

[*Click here to read more about the death of former President Philip La Follette in the Congo, which has animated much of Cecil Underwood's foreign policy.*](https://www.reddit.com/r/Presidentialpoll/comments/1epuq3y/the_death_of_philip_la_follette_peacockshah/)

-President Underwood has reaffirmed the American commitment to an anti-communist “Iron Curtain” in the Pacific. Within his first week in office, he would order the recommencement of nuclear tests in Sakhalin, which has been transferred to Chinese sovereignty, while supporting General Wang Jingguo’s Chinese government in suppressing an uprising by Zhao Ziyang’s Communist Party and finalizing [their conquests of Xinjiang](https://www.reddit.com/r/Presidentialpoll/comments/1epbjrp/xinjiang_is_in_good_order_psae/) and [role in a coup in Tibet](https://www.reddit.com/r/Presidentialpoll/comments/1ez2uqo/lhasa_spring_psae/), although Wang would be ousted within the ruling Guominjun by Tang Shengzhi in 1963, who has continued China’s course as a maverick nation within APTO.

-To that end, China would test its first nuclear weapon in 1964, to the reticent congratulations of the Underwood Administration, who would avoid criticism to hail it as a victory for APTO nations at an APTO Summit in early 1964, which would feature a keynote address by Ambassador to the Congo Max Yergan in an attempt to win the further support of APTO nations. However, Ambassador to APTO Henry Cabot Lodge would be reported as privately mocking Yergan’s diplomatic abilities.

-Peru’s Communist leader Jorge del Prado Chavez has accused the American NSA of being behind a 1962 coup d’etat that ousted him from power in favor of a supposedly temporary military junta.

-President Underwood would retain Alfred Winslow Jones, a revolutionary turned investor and economic advisor to President Tugwell, to lead the Peace Corps formed in 1961. While centered around training Americans to volunteer in the developing world, at Jones’ insistence the Corps has also recruited aid recipients to come to the United States for work in poor communities, arguing that doing so will allow the United States to benefit directly from the program while preventing a “*culture of inferiority*.”

-Much of the Administration’s foreign policy has centered around securing foreign support for American intervention in the Congo against the Pied Noir minority government, which has won the diplomatic support of France and Canada as the global left, nations such as pre-1962 Peru and the RSFSR have backed Patrice Lumumba, leaving the United States and British Empire to attempt to secure diplomatic legitimacy for their preferred government of Moise Tshombe.

-Farmer-Labor Senator W.J.B. Dorn has alleged that Charles Lindbergh’s former personal pilot and a protege seen as a likely contender to win Lindbergh’s support to seek the presidency after his military retirement, Air Force General Benjamin O. Davis Jr., was unfairly passed over for the position of Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff in favor of Army General William Westmoreland. Among Underwood’s critics for the choice has been former President Quesada, who has remained a partisan of a fighter center air strategy and continued to trade barbs with his old rival Curtis LeMay, who has argued that Underwood has failed to adequately make use of American air power in the Congo. Quesada has made repeated visits to both the White House and the Congo and has been rumored to be lobbying for Westmoreland’s removal in favor of either Davis or Quesada’s own protege, Spike Momyer.

-Among those backing up LeMay’s criticisms have been William F. Buckley and Henry Luce, both of whom have floated the idea of the usage of nuclear weapons against both Pied Noir and Lumumbist forces in the Congo. However, Congressional doves such as Jacob Javits, despite having voted for the initial House Resolution authorizing the use of military force in the Congo, have risen to oppose the war, accusing it of being at the behest of a “*military industrial complex*.” Groups have begun to organize against American involvement, particularly on college campuses.

[Blackout on the New York skyline amidst the General Strike of 1963.](https://preview.redd.it/ssu9m6f3vukd1.png?width=624&format=png&auto=webp&s=9b7862df9be202b3b49e048d92500e1c12db4982)

**Domestic Policy:**

-With Underwood’s assault on the New State in full swing and Preservationists leading the polls for the upcoming midterm elections, Farmer-Labor would turn to its roots, using fears of President Underwood reorganizing the cabinet to weaken the Labor Department to inflame a General Trades Union left apathetic after the Tugwell presidency. With Farmer-Labor holding its place in Congress after a campaign promising to entirely obstruct the Underwood Administration’s domestic policy, particularly flagship attempts to extend health and childcare coverage, the General Trades Union would begin the series of strikes marking the greatest domestic labor unrest since the Revolution in a motley coalition of fascists seeking to protect the New State, socialists skeptical of the war in the Congo and demanding of a more expansive social policy, and bread and butter organizers seeking to affirm the GTU’s special position in American society.

-Taken aback by the dominance of obstructionists within his party in the midterms and deferring to an elderly John L. Lewis’s call for labor action, Jimmy Hoffa would announce a nationwide general strike in December of 1962, bringing the American steel industry, airlines, postal service, shipping, and many larger farms relying on seasonal agriculture labor to a grinding halt as millions of workers abandoned their factories for picket lines, demanding higher wages, the rehiring of all laid off federal employees, and the maintenance of the Labor Department, as President Underwood accused the strikers of treason and noted the [extensive funding given to the cause by fascist financier Joseph Kennedy](https://www.reddit.com/r/Presidentialpoll/comments/1eptvpj/national_labor_peacockshah_alternate_elections/), who would explicitly cite his effort as an attempt to undermine the Underwood Administration.

-As weeks grew into months with President Underwood refusing to come to the table for negotiations and radical politicians and labor leaders such as Fidel Castro calling more workers to join the cause, American cities would find themselves without power, sanitation, or mail as the national economy declined, a decrease in production skyrocketed prices, and police strikes left crime at its highest point since the presidency of Alf Landon. Yet Underwood would refuse Treasury Secretary Pierre Rinfret’s entreaties to use presidential power to cut the work week to three days, limit consumption, or utilize price controls, instead heeding the advice of party conservatives. Taking to the airwaves to address countless American homes through television and radio on March 19th of 1963, Underwood announced that all striking federal employees would be laid off if they did not return to their positions within 24 hours, causing many marches to spiral into riots left unchecked by striking police, leaving J. Edgar Hoover’s NSA and, controversially, the military to fill the gap.

-Hoffa’s contemptuous GTU would call Underwood’s bluff, resulting in the firing–and, in many cases, arrests–of over 60,000 federal employees ranging from postal workers to air traffic controllers. Demanding that the economy reopen, Underwood would order the arrest of any strikers connected to violence against scabs and largely illegal immigrant migrant workers, by the NSA and use the military to disperse workers blocking federal roads, airports, and railroads, while having the Blackshirts, who had assisted strikers in a tenuous alliance against the government, declared a terrorist organization, allowing the NSA to arrest its leadership and members en masse. Meanwhile, the President implored corporations to violate their union contracts and hire scabs, inflaming the strike as Fidel Castro and John L. Lewis declared that any negotiations were now untenable, even as it prevented a total economic freeze.

-The very John L. Lewis who had gained his stature by standing with the United States government in 1920 against his intra-union communist rivals amidst the Revolution would now promise no compromise with Walter Reuther’s proteges Leonard Woodcock and Lane Kirkland as President Underwood informed a hostile Congress that “*the state of the union is not good*” in an unprecedented address. However, former rivals George Meany and Jimmy Hoffa would clandestinely plot against the man to whom they owed their career in labor, maneuvering behind Lewis’s back to begin secret negotiations for the end of strikes in April of 1963 owing to the stringent support both have given to the American war effort in the Congo. In this, they would find the support of Jesse Unruh’s perennial intraparty rival Gerald Ford, former President Alf Landon, and former Farmer-Labor Senate Leader Robert M. La Follette Jr., who had grown weary of strikes he saw as overly influenced by the Blackshirt hard line of fascism.

-Communicating secretly to the Underwood Administration via Vice President Frances Perkins, the group would demand that all businesses targeted by the strike lower their retirement age for blue-collar workers to 62 while increasing pensions by 4%. Further, although twenty years of government departments have been left effectively gutted, the group would secure a public promise from Underwood not to use the precedent set by fascist presidents in creating the departments to abolish them, in addition to a promise of a permanent 14% “emergency increase” in the pensions of all workers removed as a part of the culling of the New State and a guarantee to California farm leader Cesar Chavez that Underwood would increase the presence of the Border Patrol on the Rio Grande under the terms of the 1961 [Mills-Gitlow Act,](https://www.reddit.com/r/Presidentialpoll/comments/1eqmhvg/the_millsgitlow_act_peacockshahs_alternate/) itself the most comprehensive immigration reform bill in American history.

-Further, Ford and La Follette would support the passage of an altered version of President Underwood’s proposed omnibus proposal, increasing the national land value tax from 27% to 36% and enacting a national “sin tax” on alcohol and tobacco products of 75% to fund the “Cecilcare” universal healthcare program via an individual mandate coupled with private sector price controls, while including funding for an expansion in medical training and a federal public catastrophic care plan, additionally covering annual doctor visits and prenatal care. In order to win Farmer-Labor support, however, the package would no longer lower income tax rates as desired by Underwood, while including a federal program of government assistance to put the unemployed through trade school, as well as to train former coal workers to enter the nuclear power sector.

-Seven months into the national ordeal, Underwood and his co-conspirators would unveil their plan, to the fury of John L. Lewis and his allies in the GTU, who would dub Ford, Landon, and Lewis’s own proteges Hoffa and Meany as traitors. As a Ford led revolt among Farmer-Laborites against Unruh and obstruction amidst the crisis allowed the omnibus bill to pass the House, Fidel Castro and Harold J. Gibbons would ally with John L. Lewis to attempt to expel the negotiators from the union. However, Joe Kennedy would drive a knife firmly into the back of his strange bedfellow Lewis, viewing his strikes as having extended too far. With Kennedy’s cash flowing to Hoffa and Meany, both would narrowly survive votes of expulsion. In a similar vein, the opposition of Gerald Ford would sink an attempt by Jesse Unruh to impeach President Underwood on charges of dereliction of duty, leaving the man once labeled the Czar of the House impotent and inspiring negative comparisons to the ability of Speaker Clarence Dill to run roughshod over the Depression era Landon Administration.

-Meanwhile, Underwood would work through Perkins and Rinfret to communicate with a group of Farmer-Labor Senators led by Vance Hartke of Indiana, who would form a new vanguard against their party’s obstructionist majority led by Virginia Senator Henry Howell. Recognizing that the strike had fueled an increase in offshoring, the Hartke Amendments to the omnibus bill soon to be christened the American Recovery Act would increase tariffs across the board in an attempt to protect blue-collar jobs in the United States and appeal to the GTU’s anti-important sensibilities. Further, Hartke would form an informal alliance with Progressive House Whip Herman Badillo, with Badillo working his colleagues to vote to approve a more extreme Hartke Amendment allocating fifty million dollars to subsidize American industry in return for Hartke convincing several erstwhile obstructionist Farmer-Labor Senators to vote in favor of a billion dollar road improvement plan proposed by the Underwood Administration targeting at rural areas and aiming to reemploy many former government employees, while transitioning them into private sector work within five years.

-The final version of the American Recovery Act would find a surprising but invaluable friend in Alabama Governor Carl Elliott. Sympathetic to its social welfare programs and opposing widespread striking as hurtful to the economy his fascist state had built, Elliott would declare “*I have not come to shout* ‘*back to work,’ nor or have I come to sing…there must be a middle ground*” and work to convince Alabama Senators Aubrey Willis Williams and his own intraparty rival Jim Folsom to vote in favor of the omnibus compromise proposal despite Castro and Lewis promising to extend their strikes into Alabama, which had previously avoided the state at Joe Kennedy’s urging, if Elliott participated in the compromise. However, with the public backing of every living former Farmer-Labor President, Elliott would charge forth to meet with President Underwood, securing a downgrading of the Blackshirts’ illegal status only hours before Hartke’s allies broke a filibuster of the compromise proposals by Burton K. Wheeler, leaving the American Recovery Act to finally pass on July 17th, 1963, to be signed by President Underwood on July 20th, the very day of the moon landing.

-Despite this series of compromises, specific strikes such as a Florida teachers’ strike that has shut down the state’s public education system have continued unabated with the support of Lewis, Woodcock, Reuther, Gibbons, and Castro. Meanwhile, President Underwood has continued to use the crisis to his advantage, proposing a ban on public sector unions; an Occupational Safety and Health Administration; and denouncing the influence of the General Trades Union and its political wing in Farmer-Labor, which he has aimed to permanently weaken through a proposed National Industrial Relations Court. For his part, Pierre Rinfret has called for a Family Assistance Plan centered around a negative income tax, soon championed by Nixon and Underwood. No significant legislation has passed Congress since the ARA, leaving Underwood to begin a national campaign to humiliate the legislative branch through television and radio appearances pondering “*where did Congress go?*” as he maintains a countdown of bills passed by Congress since the midterms in an attempt to blame Farmer-Labor for the continued economic struggles and inflation in the wake of the general strike.

-Announcing that his administration would focus on “*urban-rural partnership*,” the Underwood Administration has abandoned Tugwell’s efforts to depopulate poor rural areas to planned cities such as Culloden, Texas. While focusing on encouraging private investment in rural areas and improving infrastructure, Underwood’s gutting of the Department of Planning has left Tugwell’s cities, sprawling suburbs that featured public transit between neighborhoods maintaining internal greenspace and walkability, economically challenged without Department of Planning jobs or an established private sector.

-Former President Rexford Tugwell has partnered with animation tycoon Walt Disney and futurist Jacque Fresco to design the [Experimental Prototype Community of Tomorrow (EPCOT)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Presidentialpoll/comments/1esjn3p/the_experimental_prototype_community_of_tomorrow/). While many states would view the proposal to build a utopian city as infeasible, the Puerto Rican government would attempt to win the contract under the influence of Tugwell’s protege Teodoro Moscoso. However, geographical concerns regarding the island’s size would lead the trio to turn to the untapped plains of Nebraska, still suffering from the Revolution and its rural areas declining after Tugwell era depopulation. Despite [the fierce opposition of Nebraska Progressive Congressman Bob Dole](https://www.reddit.com/r/Presidentialpoll/comments/1ev29au/dole_writes_to_disney_peacockshah_alternate/), Governor Terry Carpenter has permitted the plan to go forth near the former town of Stockville, left completely abandoned after its population was transferred south to a planned city by the Tugwell Administration. Planning of the experimental community has only entered its preliminary stages.

-The Underwood Administration has ended enforcement of the Agricultural Adjustment Act of 1959, providing government funds to pay farmers not to produce as a means of lowering supply to increase prices, and has returned to a policy of purchasing farm surpluses for sale abroad.

-Bringing back Quesada era Energy Secretary Dixy Lee Ray, President Underwood has continued to support the expansion of nuclear power, but has privatized the two dozen government owned nuclear plants of the Tugwell era and worked to build an additional fifty over the next ten years, all of which are planned as public-private partnerships.

-Will Wilson, the former Governor of Texas and Special Counsel appointed to investigate fascist Alabama under President Quesada, would be brought on as Attorney General to oversee a revival of Quesada’s “Alabama Project.” Beginning a series of lawsuits against Alabama’s government for refusing to abide by federal orders since Milford W. Howard consolidated power in the 1910s, Wilson would help organize the first statewide slate of anti-fascist candidates in the elections of 1962 opposed to Governor Carl Elliott; although thoroughly defeated statewide, a handful of anti-fascists have become the first to serve in the largely powerless unicameral legislature since 1914.

-The Environmental Protection Agency founded under the presidency of Charles Lindbergh has been among the New State agencies most downsized, with civilian groups mobilized since the 1930s to promote environmental nationalism disbanded and regulations around waste dumping lightened, despite President Underwood presiding over the creation of the world’s first plastic recycling plant in Alabama.

-President Underwood has proposed that forty million acres of land in the United States be opened for drilling and mining by 1980, with the area leased to both coal mining and nuclear power each quintupling over his tenure in office. Interior Secretary Johnson Holy Rock has approached these decisions with reticence and focused instead on protecting the legal rights of Great Plains Tribes affected by Native removal.

-President Underwood has promised to balance the federal budget if he is to win a second term, citing falling deficits from years of cuts to social programs and a continually growing economy.

-Quipping that it is meant for his enemies in Farmer-Labor, President Underwood has unsuccessfully suggested the creation of a Department of Mental Health.

-In the aftermath of the 1960 census, the number of electoral votes has been changed to 596 to accommodate the inclusion of Quebec.

-President Underwood would immediately order the end to all federal population control programs, primarily via eugenics and birth control, and has fired all federal employees in the field, while disturbing many socially liberal supporters by completely impounding federal funds previously used to promote abortion or birth control.

-Senator George McGovern has worked to protect the name of the state of Dakota, once known as Clay, against an attempt by Preservationists to change a name seen as associated with the state’s Senator turned Revolutionary President Richard F. Pettigrew.

-The rivalry between Burger King’s bison burger and the iconic McDonald’s hippo burger has continued to heat up alongside the so-called “Cola Wars” between Pepsi Cola and RC Cola, the latter coming to an agreement guaranteeing placement in all McDonald’s restaurants.

-Church of Immanuel President John Erhlichman has shifted the group’s focus to attempt to win respectability, while branching out internationally under the leadership of men appointed as prophets such as Korea’s Sun Myung-Moon and the Philippines’ Eraño Manalo.

-Although the Underwood Administration has abandoned Tugwell’s proposal of a monument on Georgia’s Stone Mountain featuring the visages of four Farmer-Labor presidents, it has supported the creation of a less partisan mountain monument to presidents.

-After a one point defeat to Northern Ireland in 1958, Brasil claimed the title at the 1962 FIFA World Cup.

-College football has [defied all predictions](https://www.reddit.com/r/Presidentialpoll/comments/1expox6/1964_sports_illustrated_college_football_preview/) as star Heisman Trophy winner Dick Butkus led Chicago to their first Big 10 title since 1929, with the team finishing #2 after beating #8 Vancouver in the Rose Bowl; meanwhile, #1 Arkansas beat #3 Vanderbilt in the Cotton Bowl to be declared the AP and Coaches Poll National Champion.

-Leaving the unsuccessful Liverpool band The Beatles, whose attempt to gain experience through concert gigs in Hamburg would be foiled by unrest in Germany against French influence, drummer Pete Best has become an international sensation with a solo career kickstarted by an appearance on *The Ed Sullivan Show*. Another popular drummer, Ringo Starr of the Hurricanes, has also gained extensive fame.

-As Walt Disney shifts his focus to the creation of EPCOT, Fleischer Brothers Animation Studios has overtaken Disney in the entertainment market for the first time, releasing the ambitious *The Emperor's Nightingale* utilizing an Asian style of paper cut-out animation.

-The 1963 Academy Award winning film *Antony and Cleopatra* has become controversial for allegedly depicting its portrayal of Julius Caesar as an allegory for the presidency of Philip La Follette, while others would view the 1961 action film *The Guns of Hawai’i* as overly critical in its portrayal of Aaron Burr Houston as seeking to foment the First Pacific War through his vision of annexing Hawai’i. Meanwhile, resurrecting a franchise that began as Japanese propaganda, 1962’s *King Kong vs. Godzilla* would be the first American-Japanese co-production since the Third Pacific War and has been met with positive reviews in both nations.

-Notable inventions during President Underwood’s term include a prototype cell phone, floppy disk, and Pringles.

**The Supreme Court:**

-Tugwell’s Castro-Trumbo Act of 1960, limiting all future land ownership to 500 acres while explicitly authorizing the Department of Planning to use the power of eminent domain for the redistribution of current lands, would immediately cease to be enforced by the Underwood Administration, who have labeled the law unconstitutional in a case pending review by the Supreme Court. Meanwhile, in *Unruh v. Underwood, et al.*, Speaker of the House Jesse Unruh has sued the President for refusing to enforce land reform.

-In the landmark 1962 decision *Engel v. Vitale,* Justice G. Harold Carswell would author the majority opinion of a 6-3 court upholding the practice of prayer in schools on the grounds of the Jesus Amendment. Celebrating the decision, President Underwood would instruct the Department of Education to mandate school prayer federally and require the placement of the Ten Commandments in public schools.

-However, Carswell would author a dissent in the landmark *Gideon v. Wainwright,*  a 6-3 decision upholding the right of legal counsel to those accused of crime, with Chief Justice Hugo Black authoring the majority opinion.

-[A former NSA lawyer turned freshman Progressive Representative named G. Gordon Liddy](https://www.reddit.com/r/Presidentialpoll/comments/1ewbfg6/the_impeachment_of_john_sirica_peacockshahs/?share_id=g73nx0T2Njv__Uf7gME2z&utm_content=1&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=ioscss&utm_source=share&utm_term=1) skyrocketed to the fore of American politics after continuing an investigation begun under President Tugwell into Justice John J. Sirica, fielding accusations as wide in scope as connections to the mafia and closeted homosexuality.

-Powered by the smoking gun testimony of law clerk Antonin Scalia, the House of Representatives voted to impeach Sirica on articles of impeachment relating to corruption, dereliction of duty, and perjury, who has become the first Supreme Court Justice to be convicted and removed from office since 1866 after a trial in the Senate. With a national approval rating of 60%, Liddy’s leading role in the removal of Sirica has led him to a position as the ranking member of a new House Internal Security Committee, where his career has been benefited by a tight alliance with Progressive Senators Bebe Rebozo and Roy Cohn.

-With obstruction carrying the day in a Farmer-Labor dominated Senate, John J. Sirica’s seat on the Supreme Court remains vacant. However, President Underwood has nominated Non-Partisan League Chairman Thurgood Marshall to the role, in what many have seen as an attempt to embarrass Senate Farmer-Laborites through opposition to a nominee widely popular, including among many on the party’s left.

-The obstruction of appointments to the judiciary by President Underwood has extended far beyond Sirica, with all judicial nominations made by the President since the 1962 midterms blocked by a Congress leveraging 3 day *pro forma* recesses to prevent the President from utilizing the power of recess appointments. Other nominations, such as that of Arthur Burns to lead the Federal Reserve, have also been blocked.

-James Henderson-Stewart’s National Liberals would win a landslide victory over Hugh Gaitskell’s Labour Party in the 1963 British general election, as the Tories remain confined to third place.

-Ramon Magsaysay would win election in 1961 to a full term as President of the Philippines, turning back a challenge from Ferdinand Marcos, and has continued the implementation of the Georgist model in the Philippines, taking inspiration from Hector Sandler’s Argentina.

-Saskatchewan Premier and leader of the opposition New Democratic Party Tommy Douglas conclusively lost two Canadian federal elections at the hands of Progressive Conservative leader John Diefenbaker, who has emphasized [anti-American nationalism](https://www.reddit.com/r/Presidentialpoll/comments/1euwf2x/top_secret_the_victoria_project_peacockshah/) in the aftermath of the loss of the nation’s Atlantic provinces. Rumors hold that the NSA has unearthed classified information on the Canadian military, but details remain scarce.

-Spanish right wing Prime Minister Jose Maria Gil-Robles has attempted to ban Santiago Carrillo’s Communist Party, a stance that would lose him re-election to a broad left wing alliance led by Rodolfo Llopis’s PSOE in a campaign marked by an exchange of insults in a public feud with leftist activist Rafael Alberti.

-Brazil's social democratic President Cassiano Ricardo won re-election in 1964 against his former ally Plinio Salgado, who has increasingly moved to the right politically and embraced his own take on Howardite fascism.

Last Sunday was [the **hottest day on earth**](https://phys.org/news/2024-07-monday-hottest-day-earth-sunday.html) in recorded history—until Monday, that is. [According to NOAA](https://www.ncei.noaa.gov/cdo-web/datatools/records), there have been **over 36,000 daily max heat temperature records** broken worldwide so far this year. The UN Secretary-General [stated](https://phys.org/news/2024-07-humanity-extreme-epidemic-chief.html) that “Billions of people are facing an **extreme heat epidemic**—wilting under increasingly deadly heat waves, with temperatures topping 50 degrees Celsius around the world.”

**Typhoon Gaemi** [plowed through the Philippines](https://apnews.com/article/philippines-typhoon-gaemi-monsoon-rains-flooding-f847a7f030e3a8f1dba865aa4b159f4f), killing at least 13, before [heading to Taiwan](https://www.bangkokpost.com/world/2834887/typhoon-gaemi-brings-philippines-taiwan-to-a-halt), and then China, where [300,000+ people were evacuated](https://phys.org/news/2024-07-typhoon-gaemi-displaces-eastern-china.html) and [12+ killed](https://apnews.com/article/china-typhoon-tropical-storm-gaemi-taiwan-philippines-3fdd5c362596193f3c7b1cabad3bce56). Gusts [reached 240 km/hr](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/crg41eg517vo) (150 mph). Some writers [are saying](https://www.independent.co.uk/climate-change/climate-100/climate-change-2024-global-warming-b2582736.html) that 2024 is “**history’s tipping point for climate change**” and that we still have time to turn this ship around—while students of human nature know it is far too late. [Storm Prapiroon struck China](https://archive.ph/0vtbe) just before Gaemi, flooding a number of streets; in the week previous, at least 36 people died in China from flooding.

Antarctic sea ice [dropped to almost-record lows](https://x.com/EliotJacobson/status/1815368566935372261) last week, more than 5 standard deviations below the average for July. [This photo essay](https://www.aljazeera.com/gallery/2024/7/21/photos-in-the-andes-glaciers-are-shrinking-fast-endangering-millions) captures the **rapid shrinking of Chile’s Andean glaciers**, and the melting of ancient permafrost. Meanwhile, Australia’s Queensland province [hit 111-year lows](https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/article/2024/jul/22/qld-weather-cold-snap-queensland-temperature-brisbane-cape-york) on Monday. 

Badin, Pakistan [had a record warm night](https://x.com/extremetemps/status/1815309578726166534) (30 °C) last week. At least [9 locations in Japan](https://x.com/extremetemps/status/1814977400079278555) hit record warm temperatures this month. Last Sunday saw yet another [**record average surface temperature**](https://x.com/EliotJacobson/status/1815560369890558270), 17.09 °C (62.7 °F). Parts of Morocco [hit all-time highs](https://x.com/extremetemps/status/1816179996269916246) last week as well, peaking at 48.3 °C (119 °F). Jasper, Alberta (pop: ~5,000) [**burns**](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/7/25/our-worst-nightmare-raging-wildfire-hits-western-canada-town-of-jasper). 

**Flooding in Ethiopia** [killed 229+ people](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c728l7ng2q0o), with many more probably stuck dead in the mudslides; some [estimates say](https://www.theguardian.com/world/article/2024/jul/25/death-toll-from-ethiopia-landslides-could-reach-500-un-agency-says) 500+ dead *in toto*. Slovenia faced [flooding and landslides](https://www.euronews.com/my-europe/2024/07/21/torrential-rain-in-northern-slovenia-triggers-landslides) as well, though no deaths have been reported. Liberia is considering [**moving its capital**](https://www.rfi.fr/en/africa/20240722-liberia-contemplates-moving-capital-after-disastrous-flooding) because of consistent flooding. 

Sicily’s grape harvest has [begun earlier than ever](https://www.yahoo.com/news/earliest-ever-start-sicilian-grape-124419345.html)—12 days earlier, to be precise. An [**oil spill**](https://phys.org/news/2024-07-philippines-environmental-catastrophe-oil.html) happened in the Philippines when a tanker sunk in Manila Bay; mitigation efforts are ongoing. A [study](https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/sciadv.adn6106) in *Science Advances* determined that [there is a strong relationship](https://phys.org/news/2024-07-underscores-relationship-saharan-hurricane-rainfall.html) between Sahara dust and Atlantic hurricane formation…yet the study suggests that thin amongst od dust can repress hurricanes, while large amounts may instigate hurricanes…

The UN Food and Agriculture Agency (FAO) released a 122-page [report on “**The State of the World’s Forests**”](https://openknowledge.fao.org/server/api/core/bitstreams/c11c251d-b204-4abc-ab48-ecfa33fe7eff/content) last week, portraying a worrisome, if overall optimistic, view on the world’s trees. Global deforestation rates are down from their highs, though the planet still loses forest cover each year. Yet the report also claims that several nations actually gained forest cover from 2010-2020, led by China and, distantly, Australia. The report contains 18 case studies of regions and how they manage(d) their forests. Another [study](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-024-50070-0) published in *Nature Communications* quantified the amount of light absorbed by black carbon clouds, like [those formed](https://phys.org/news/2024-07-quantify-solar-absorption-black-carbon.html) by large wildfires.

>“Wildfire intensity and frequency are increasing….**Global wood production is at record levels**….An average of around 25 percent of species in assessed animal and plant groups are threatened, suggesting that about 1 million species already face extinction, many within decades….Ten countries account for two-thirds of the global forest area….Climate change is making forests more vulnerable to invasive species, causing changes in their geographic distribution and seasonal phenology and in aspects of population dynamics…” -excerpts from the report

A *Nature Climate Change* [study](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41558-024-02057-4) determined that “that non-permafrost systems store additional carbon with increases in summer plant growth, but in permafrost ecosystems, carbon losses in the fall and winter were substantial enough to be offset by similar increases in summer uptake.” According to [a summary](https://phys.org/news/2024-07-arctic-global-climate.html) of our permafrost predicament, “researchers expect additional emissions from the Arctic permafrost to accelerate future climate change by 10%–20%, with an anticipated **impact comparable to a large, industrialized nation** by 2100.”

Worldwide, [**coal consumption is expected to peak**](https://archive.ph/OYidA) this year, 2024, before sliding down to 2001 levels by the year 2050. China currently accounts for 56% of global coal demand, with 13% from India. The Guardian released [an online tool](https://www.theguardian.com/environment/ng-interactive/2023/sep/20/europes-pollution-divide-see-how-your-area-compares) to examine **air pollution** levels in most of Europe. Poland, the Balkans, and Italy’s Po Valley are particularly polluted. 

Danish scientists examined Greenland’s glacial lakes from 2008-2022 and found that [326 glacial lakes produced 541 glacial lake outburst floods](https://archive.ph/7tm74), particularly in the year 2019. The researchers say glaciers in the region are **melting twice as fast** as in the 20th century. Meanwhile, data from England found that [last winter had the **most flood warnings**](https://www.yourweather.co.uk/news/trending/winter-flood-warnings-on-england-s-best-farmland-hit-record-high.html) **ever**, beating previous records by about 20%. In Japan, [two people were slain](https://phys.org/news/2024-07-thousands-evacuated-pound-northern-japan.html) and thousands forced to evacuate due to flooding in the north. 

Every country of West Virginia [is in a state of emergency](https://governor.wv.gov/News/press-releases/2024/Pages/Gov.-Justice-announces-State-of-Emergency-for-all-55-counties-due-to-dangerous-drought-conditions.aspx) due to Drought. A former Canadian forest scientist said Banff National Park is “[so **primed to burn**](https://calgaryherald.com/news/local-news/primed-to-burn-former-parks-canada-forestry-scientist-fears-the-worst-for-banff)” because of a “perfect storm created by our ecosystem, **bugs and beetles, fuel, climate change and urbanization**.” A [heat wave in Morocco](https://www.thecanary.co/global/world-news/2024/07/25/morocco-heatwave/) slew 21+ people in 24 hours. Record [hot nights](https://x.com/extremetemps/status/1816762234296574054) in South Korea and in [Southeast Asia](https://x.com/extremetemps/status/1816390730190909885). Bolivia [smashed its old winter records](https://x.com/extremetemps/status/1816947190696468525) for temperatures, with some places exceeding 39 °C (102 °F).

Despite claims by the U.S. EPA that PFAS chemicals are not in pesticides, a study confirmed that [over 14% of **active ingredients in American pesticides are PFAS**](https://www.theguardian.com/environment/article/2024/jul/23/pfas-pesticides-epa-research)—and over 30% of new pesticide chemicals approved within the last 10 years are PFAS chemicals. A number of condom brands [tested positive for PFAS](https://www.theguardian.com/environment/article/2024/jul/28/condoms-pfas-forever-chemicals), as did their lubricants. 

In Arizona, [a few cases were confirmed of **hantavirus**](https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/hantavirus-arizona-warn-spread-potentially-fatal-rcna162593)—a respiratory virus spread by rodents, for which there is no vaccine/treatment. Meanwhile, the U.S. FDA [approved a **rapid test**](https://www.msn.com/en-us/health/other/fda-approves-rapid-test-to-combat-deadly-candida-auris/ar-BB1qgUXJ?item=flightsprg-tipsubsc-v1a?loadIn=defaultBrowser%20) **for *Candida Auris***—which was also [detected in Hong Kong](https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202407/24/P2024072400335.htm) recently.

[**Polio in Gaza**](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/crgrxjn9rkpo) is circulating in the unregulated wastewater—and the WHO is growing more concerned about serious impacts to health. More urgently is the imminent risk of starvation in Gaza, and across many other parts of the globe. The UN FAO released [a 286-page report](https://openknowledge.fao.org/server/api/core/bitstreams/31af4e18-aaeb-4164-991e-2431fe9d41ca/content) on **food (in)security today**. The report indicated that food insecurity is at an 18-year high, with almost 750,000 people facing “undernourishment.” Nevertheless, the report predicts that those numbers will decrease by 2030 for all continents, except Africa, which [is expected](https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/article/2024/jul/24/africa-to-overtake-asia-with-highest-number-of-hungry-people-by-2030-says-un) to overtake Asia for having the most hungry individuals. The [report](https://openknowledge.fao.org/server/api/core/bitstreams/a0159056-2843-44c2-91e6-601ec4704fb8/content/cd1254en.html#gsc.tab=0) contains useful graphs and data tables, and [blames climate change & conflict](https://archive.ph/9UOaL) for much of the food crisis.

>“Between 713 and 757 million people may have faced hunger in 2023 – one out of 11 people in the world, and one out of every five in Africa….Previous editions of this report have repeatedly highlighted the intensification of several major drivers of food insecurity and malnutrition, specifically conflict, climate variability and extremes, and economic slowdowns and downturns….estimates of **adult obesity show a steady increase over the last decade**, from 12.1 percent in 2012 to 15.8 percent in 2022….The five countries with the largest numbers of people facing high levels of acute food insecurity were, in descending order, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Nigeria, the Sudan, Afghanistan and Ethiopia, while the countries with the largest share of the analysed population facing high levels of acute food insecurity were Palestine (Gaza Strip), South Sudan, Yemen, the Syrian Arab Republic and Haiti. One hundred percent of the population of the Gaza Strip faced high levels of acute food insecurity, as did more than half of the people living in South Sudan, Yemen and the Syrian Arab Republic, and nearly half the population of Haiti.” -excerpts from the report

Ireland’s data centers [consumed 21% of all electricity](https://www.theguardian.com/world/article/2024/jul/23/ireland-datacentres-overtake-electricity-use-of-all-homes-combined-figures-show) generated by the country last year—exceeding all domestic use combined (at 18%). Renewable energy accounted for about 16% of Ireland’s energy production last year, mostly wind. China is planning to [**raise the retirement age**](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cpd9v48yn8ro) over the next 5 years—perhaps by a total of 5 years. Pre-COVID estimates projected the state’s pension budget to be exhausted by 2035.

A 242-page [pre-publication study](https://nap.nationalacademies.org/read/27756/chapter/1#iii) on Long COVID and disability counts many of the 200+ symptoms of Long COVID. They include, but are certainly not limited to: **immune system dysfunction, heart disease, fatigue, brain fog, various gastrointestinal problems, and cognitive impairment.** I got many of the traditional COVID symptoms last week, but nevertheless I tested negative for COVID…I suspect I still have COVID, and this was a false negative; it would be my second case of COVID, and my symptoms are similar to my earlier experience almost two years ago. Nobody around me seems to take any precautions, or care about the virus whatsoever… Is it a sign of how resigned we are to living in a broken, purposeless, misdirected society—or have we all simply been **gaslit by crowd psychology** into believing that COVID isn’t dangerous anymore, or something else? 

The 2024 AIDS Conference reported that, for the first time ever, more new HIV infections happened outside sub-Saharan Africa than occurred within the region. A thorough [300-page report](https://www.unaids.org/sites/default/files/media_asset/2024-unaids-global-aids-update_en.pdf) on the fight against HIV/AIDS was released last week.

A pre-publication *Nature* [study](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-024-07849-4) confirmed that **H5N1 is now transmissible between mammals**, or at least cows. Bird flu has been confirmed to have been spread between cows, and from dairy cows to a cat & a raccoon.

A Critique of 'Babel' by R. F. Kuang,204,Fantasy,https://www.reddit.com/r/Fantasy/comments/16l3dy3/a_critique_of_babel_by_r_f_kuang/,1694964060.0,"[Goodreads](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/57945316-babel?ac=1&from_search=true&qid=OusYv4pw7r&rank=1)

I found The Poppy War trilogy to be a flawed, but fun series. I initially wasn’t planning on reading ‘Babel.’ But then this book was nominated for/won a ton of awards, and I got curious. I decided to give this a try despite my misgivings.

I found ‘Babel’ frustrating. At moments, brilliant. But mostly average to below average. I feel like this cake needed to be baked for another year or two.

If I were to describe my relationship with Kuang’s work, I’d say she’s one of my favorite authors for her conceptual work, but I don't find these books spellbinding. I skimmed through parts of this due to lack of enjoyment. On the other hand, her books give me a chance to do research and reflect on history, which is something no other working author really gives me a chance to do. I really love doing in-depth reviews like this, and Kuang is one of the few authors which lets me do it.

I’m going to explain my negative (and positive!) thoughts on this work of art. This was a challenging work of art which demands being taken seriously. Spoilers Below. I’m writing this review in good faith, as one author reviewing another’s book, trying to balance positives with negatives. As part of my preparation for reading this, I listened to 2 thirty hour long lecture series on both the British Empire, and also the Chinese Empire of this era.

* The Chinese poppy wars

WARNING! QUIT READING NOW UNTIL YOU FINISH READING THE BOOK! SPOILERS!

Audiences received this book with some level of controversy. This book is about racism, and I’ve seen some book reviewers say this book was bad due to how didactic this book is. No minority artist or author should feel compelled to coddle the emotions of the majority in their art. The white majority were once gatekeepers for art; only recently have minority populations gathered enough wealth and power to make art for themselves. Perhaps the author wrote ‘Babel’ for primarily a minority audience, and it was written to vent about how unjust the white Western world is for nonwhites. As a work of art, this book is valid.

Okay, with that necessary preamble done with, let’s start.

BIASES STATED

I read several of 'Babel' book review before reading this, both positive and negative. I do this with most books I read. In this case, I think the book reviews colored my opinion on this book in a negative way. HOWEVER, after reading this I do think a lot of the negative reviewers weren't willing to meet this book halfway. This is better than a lot of negative reviews say it is.

CONCEPT AND EXECUTION

This book’s concept is the lifestory of a young man who’s caught between two worlds: that of a young citizen of the British Empire who loves the products and glamour of the empire, and the oppressed colonies of that Empire which are exploited for wealth. It takes place in Oxford, a university setting where scholars utilize magic to create the Industrial Revolution. It also takes place in Canton China, where the IRL Poppy War is going on. The protagonist is biracial, half English half Chinese, and is forced to pick a side. Good concept.

I did not enjoy this book’s execution. This book is (at moments) dry as salt. A lot of this book is narrative exposition, either through the medium of dialogue or straight textual blathering. As a fantasy fan, I can tolerate infodumps and blather, but this was too much for me. As a fantasy fan, I enjoy some amount of adventure in my novels; this book lacked that sense of adventure one expects in the genre. As a result, this book felt targeted to a more mainstream literary audience as opposed to trad fantasy audience.

Now for a weird hot take: this had a similar vibe to the ‘Cradle’ books. Specifically, in the world of ‘Cradle,’ every person’s entire life revolves around leveling up by chi cycling. There are no farmers, no weavers, no plumbers; near as I can tell, everyone chi cycles as their dayjob. Every aspect of the plot and setting ultimately orbits around levelling up. ‘Cradle’ are fun books, but this setting feels unnatural.

In ‘Babel,’ every scene, character interaction, and aspect of the worldbuilding ultimately orbits the concepts of racism and colonialism. You can’t escape this worldbuilding because it colors the entire setting and story. This setting feels unnatural because every door you open, every rock you turn over, racism and colonialism turns up. 

It's okay to tell an instructive story about racism. But this got long in the tooth. I feel like there was a sharp 250 page book in this which got muddled within a 550 page book. The didactic nature of this story would have worked in a shorter text.

FFS, I am a scholar myself; I read one or two nonfiction books a week. Reading a book about a booknerd should be within my wheelhouse. Something about this book went horribly wrong if I didn’t like it.

CHARACTERS AND CHARACTERIZATION

I’ve been reading reviews for ‘Babel,’ and a common criticism is that all the white characters are some shade of antagonistic: from unlikeable, to just evil. I think there is a seed of truth to the complaint.

In this book, (forgive my crude language) the English sniff their own farts; only the protagonists are smart enough to smell the fresh air. The one English protagonist, Letty, betrays the other protagonists by the end of the book. The white English do some heinous shit throughout the novel. The message is clear, and this is very much a message book.

Giving the author the benefit of the doubt, perhaps the goal was deliberately invoking cognitive dissonance in white readers. All people view themselves as the hero of their own story, therefore when a white person reads this book they might feel cognitive dissonance. That cognitive dissonance was how the author sought to discuss racism. If so, this book did a mediocre job exploring racism as a topic.

Let’s now dive into the heart of the issue: Letty. I genuinely liked her as a story mechanism. The author set out to explore the failures of moderatism. To paraphrase Dr. Martin Luther King Jr, ‘The enemy of reform is not the unapologetic racist, but the squishy moderate.’ Letty is a squishy moderate, according to this description. The author more or less directly pointed out that Letty was at best a performative ally; she leaves Hermes the moment she would be forced to make a sacrifice for her beliefs. As a mechanism of the story and a manifestation of historical forces, Letty worked.

But Letty also served to undermine the story at hand. This book bungled the execution of the message by having Letty betray the heroes. By having the one white protagonist being the twist villain, it is easy to interpret the subtext of the story as saying ‘you can’t trust those shifty white people’ even as the printed text of the book says ‘Letty betrayed us because she was protecting her family and her wealth (and also because Ramy dumped her).’

(BTW, some reviews about this book complain that ‘all white people are evil’ in this book. This subtext of ‘shifty white people’ is what so many reviewers are complaining about. More on subtext and show-don’t-tell later.)

This book opens itself up to bad-faith attacks about race in a way it wouldn’t have if one of the POC Hermes were the final traitor. Can you imagine how cool and unexpected it would have been if Ramy or Victorie were the final villain?! Having it be Ramy or Victorie would have EXTREMELY emphasized the story’s motif/theme of the Empire using the people and products of your colonies to oppress your colonies. Having it be Letty is both obvious and undermined that theme.

The author’s goal with Letty’s betrayal was saying ‘the system maintains itself through the passive acceptance of the middle classes, and the active betrayal of moderates’. If we were to re-write the book, how can we maintain that message but at the same time get rid of the subtext?

I’d suggest we add another character.

Let’s talk about the Irish Potato Famine. The famine happened because the English weren’t willing to invest in agricultural reforms in their Irish colony, even though they did reform English farms; the English would rather keep Ireland a provincial backwater. As a result, the potato blight hit HARD. I’m leaving out some nuance, but you get the point: because of English neglect, a million people died of starvation.

This example of English colonialism was *sitting one island over from this book.* The Irish Potato Famine began in 1845, while the First Opium War ended in 1842; this topic was fair game for ‘Babel’ to discuss in depth. If this story brought the Famine up, it really would have proved the book’s point. In my opinion, ‘Babel’ examined the narrative of colonialism and racism through the obvious lens of ‘whites vs nonwhites.’ Today, we feel cognitive dissonance when talking about the Irish not being counted of the white race, yet at the time the Irish were treated as 'the other.' The narrative could have weaponized this cognitive dissonance to prove a point.

(If you are interested in reading books exploring this topic, I suggest you check out Mary Robinette Kowal’s ‘Glamourist Histories’ series. That series touches on English racism and classism during this era.)

Let’s talk about the characters in general now.

When I spoke about Letty above, I commented that I liked how she served as a manifestation of historical forces. Many of the characters in this book seemed to primarily exist to serve the narrative function of conveying ideology from the author to the reader… as opposed to, you know, being a character, with thoughts, quirks, secret passions, embarrassing secrets.

Expository characters are not a bad thing innately; if you go back and read stuff by the early greats like Asimov or Heinlein, they weren’t exactly famous for writing gloriously nuanced characters. The early greats used characters to exposit sci-fi concepts. 'Babel' used characters to exposit fantasy and colonialism concepts. That’s fine, not all books have to be written in the style of super-deep, psychologically driven characters. I give this a passing grade.

SETTING AND WORLDBUILDING

I enjoyed the segments where the characters learned about the magic system/linguistics. I am a giant nerd about… well, everything, linguistics included. If you want to learn more about linguistics, I suggest you check out the youtube channels NativLang and Connor Quimby. I’ve listened to them for years, and they’re good. This book did a fun job exploring the topic.

I felt that the author did A REALLY REALLY GOOD JOB of integrating the theme of using minorities to exploit minorities. The author’s idea for the tower of Babel is just genius. The British Empire brings in impressionable youths into the tower and uses their skill in linguistics to control and oppress the people they originally came from. This interweaving of plot, magic system and setting was deft and clever and thematically rich. The magic system of the Babel translation school is literally colonialism given a magic wand.

The magic system itself was clever and cool; I wish it was featured more.

Why silver? It’s because of tea. 

Back in this era, Britain got their tea from China. However, the British Empire had a policy that exports must be greater than imports, and they would be paid in silver to make up the difference- this is called Mercantilism. (To summarize mercantilism, it means: ""Free trade for me, but not for thee."") The problem was that the British liked tea so much that the flow of silver went in the direction of China, not the other way around. So, because of the official policy of Mercantilism, the British had to make up the difference between imports and exports. China were isolationist, so they refused to import anything; therefore the British had to smuggle exports into China to balance the checkbook. And if you’re going to smuggle something, it needs to be expensive per unit weight, have a high demand and tradeable on the black market to be worth the time and effort… thus, opium. 

Therefore tea=silver=opium. The author represented this well.

(Adding a small hype moment here, this book hammered on Adam Smith and Free Trade, which I really liked. It made the British look like hypocrites because they were MASSIVE mercantilists in this era.)

By using silver as the basis of this magic, the author is thematically including this bit of lore in with the rest of the story. Robin exemplifies the British method of colonial control: the British East India Company takes silver out of China; the tower of Babel teaches the foreign students from colonized places like China to create magics to benefit the British colonial project using silver extracted from China. In this way, the British Empire uses the products of its colonies to oppress its colonies. It’s an ouroboros, a snake eating its own tail. Great work. This reflects how in the real world, the British used Indian sepoy troops to oppress India, or turned Protestant Christians against Catholic Christians in Ireland. While colonial populations fight amongst themselves, Britain extracts wealth.

And now the bad: the author took the most blunt way about telling this story, and it cost the story severely.

Britain in the real world poppy wars were SUPER morally evil. Indeed, the real world events this story were based on are so comically evil that this book comes off as comically simplified. Does that make sense? You can’t tell a subtle, nuanced story when narcostates are involved, because narcostates are evil. That was the point that the author was making, that Britain was evil when it dumped opium in China. And yet because the author accurately portrayed evil as evil, many readers who read the book and said ‘no duh evil is evil. This book is obvious and boring.’

When reading reviews for this book, I’ve noticed a common refrain. To summarize, a lot of people felt that the author was heavy handed with her social critiques. They think the narrative preached its message. We live in a jaded age; when confronted with obvious political speech, a lot of people bounce right off it. I think something like that happened here.

I think two things were the main obstacles to this book reaching that jaded audience:

&#x200B;

* The narrative approached the theme in the simplest, most blunt method possible.
   * At every turn, Robin suffered the sins of racism and colonialism, and as the reader has empathy for Robin the reader gains understanding for why racism and colonialism are bad.
   * &#x200B;
   * Because this lacked subtlety, it got repetitive and boring. That might be the narrative mechanism the author was going for, to show to the reader that minorities are constantly assaulted by discrimination daily. The author was trying to make the reader feel that constant assault. But it still is a repetitive narrative mechanism, and that which is repetitive becomes boring.
* The antagonists were all strawmen, twirly mustache evildoer types.
   * They were all bluntly evil racists. Because it was all so blunt, it felt like the author was talking down to the audience, like the narrative didn’t trust the reader to come to our own conclusions about the ethics of racism.
   * &#x200B;
   * I don’t think the author intended to sound patronizing of the reader, but I think perceiving a patronizing attitude in the text is understandable given how blunt this book is about everything.

So the author is between a rock and a hard place. Either accurately portray history as being racist and evil, and consequently write a book which readers view as being blunt. Or tone down the racism and evil and not write an accurate book.

I think the author was justified being blunt. The author tried to directly tackle the drug trade and came off as preachy as a result because you can’t say ‘there’s two sides to every story’ about the drug trade and racism.

But still, this book didn’t work for a lot of good-faith readers, including me. I think the narrative could have been structured differently to appeal to those readers without losing the message. Here are my thoughts on the-roads-not-taken.

In the real world, the British Empire expanded using more than just opium diplomacy. Did you know that quinine was a weapon of war? The British used quinine to make their soldiers immune to malaria so they could invade India and Africa. Therefore, quinine was a tool of colonialism.

Back to ‘Babel’. Now imagine if the book started with small, subtle acts of unjust colonialism and escalated slowly. Instead of opium, start with quinine. The British characters in this book can say, “Colonialism is good. We brought these natives quinine and now they live long, healthy lives free of malaria.” And the colonized characters in it can say “No, colonialism is evil. You’re using quinine to keep your army alive and oppress my people.” The reader then can think about the two arguments and decide for themselves: is the colonizer right, or the colonized? Should medicine be used as a weapon of empire at all? Then after this babystep, introduce Britain’s drug dealing opium.

What if Robin started the book completely gung-ho for the British Empire, and only slowly changed his mind as he faced more and more racism? Letty and Griffin could act as the angel and devil on Robin’s shoulder. Letty makes arguments like the one above about quinine. Robin starts the book agreeing with Letty, but slowly agrees with Griffin. The final swap happens when Robin returns to opium-addicted Canton and learns just how horrible imperialism can be. The book as-written has Robin and the crew all pretty much on the same page about the downsides of empire from the first page; writing it this other way would create a more dramatic character arc.

PLOT

Going back to what I said above, I feel like the author frequently took the most obvious solution for every problem.

This book is about racism, but basically only white-against-nonwhite racism. It barely touches the less obvious white-against-white racism, such as antisemitism or anti-Irish racism as examples. This book could have subverted expectations, while at the same time reinforced its points, by taking a more nuanced view of racism and exploring the topic fully.

Robin faces both macro and microagressions everyday in Britain. Yet when he returns to Canton at the 50% mark, he’s treated with respect by the local Chinese, in particular the ‘Handler of Barbarians’ dude. Wouldn’t it make sense if he was treated with racism back home in China? This book’s foundational worldbuilding is that racism is EVERYWHERE. Robin facing racism back in Canton would have subverted expectations, but at the same time doubled down on the foundational worldbuilding. He's seen as Chinese in Britain; wouldn't he be seen as British in China?

After Britain outlawed slavery in 1833, the Empire set up the West African Squadron of ships to patrol the coast of Africa and disrupt the slave trade. The West African Squadron saved 150,000 Africans from slavery. Britain didn’t profit off of this in any way; it was done for charity. In this case, the British Empire were actually heroes. It doesn’t make up for all the evil the Empire did, but this did happen. If the book referenced this it would have subverted expectations and humanized the British, despite their villainy. (Did the book talk about this, and I missed it?)

The primary villain in this book is the nebulous British Empire, and the narrative doesn’t make a good-faith attempt to humanize the villain. Everyone is the hero of their own story, even the British Empire. But this narrative was written with such a strong message of ‘Imperialism=Bad,’ that it ignores nuance to the real world story (e.g. the West African Squadron).

Speaking of imperialism, China is an Empire! Wouldn't it have been neat if this book explored how China's native colonialism and imperialism (for example the peasant uprising Taiping Rebellion), in light of the ideas this book was trying to examine? This would change the theme from the British being uniquely evil, to displaying the darkness native to all humanity. And given that this book is about racism, underscoring the common humanity between British and Chinese seems like a good idea.

Of the four main characters, it was Letty who betrayed the heroes to the British. I felt this was a cop out and obvious. It would have subverted expectations if Victorie or Ramy betrayed the heroes to the British, and at the same time would restate the book's thesis. Let me explain:

Thesis: Britain controls it's colonies by using local proxies.

Evidence: 

The British using Indian sepoy troops to control India. 

In Ireland, the British use Protestants to counter Catholics

Robin (Chinese) is brought to Britain to benefit Britain at the expense of China. Likewise, Ramy is brought to Oxford to benefit Britain at the expense of India, and Victorie benefits Oxfords at the expense of Haiti. 

Conclusion: Ramy or Victorie betraying Hermes would restate the author's thesis. I'd also be happy if Letty, Ramy and Victorie ALL betrayed Hermes together.

This book made obvious choices. It's valid for a story to make obvious choices some of the time, or even most of the time. But a common bit of writing advice is that when an author faces a writing problem, to throw out the first solution to that problem because if it's obvious to the author it's probably obvious to the reader too. 

One thing I liked about the plot, was how it ended. I liked how Robin makes the easy choice to die for his cause, while Victorie is forced to make the hard choice to live for hers, to struggle to survive, to escape at all costs. In the end, Robin was a coward. It was unassuming Victorie who was the real hero.

AUTHORIAL VOICE

The author herself cites that subtlety[ needn’t be a goal in and of itself ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JBj5EVDuLzw)when writing a book. I agree that subtlety needn’t be a goal in and of itself, but deciding not to use subtlety is like tying one hand behind your back before entering a fistfight. If you listen to her speaking in that link, I think she said she agreed with that position.

That said, the author writes blunt books with minimal intentional subtlety. However, subtext *is still there*, even if the author doesn’t intend it to be. The author neglects the battleground of subtext and subtlety, but readers will still read into subtext even if the author didn’t deliberately write any! 

You know how I said that having the one white protagonist betray Hermes was a mistake? This is what I mean. That’s subtext right there. When people review this book and complain it uses the ‘stereotype of evil whites,’ they read the subtext and *it’s* *right there*.

(As an aside, is this stereotype the only way to interpret the subtext of this story? Of course not. But given how despicable the average English person in this story is, a reader seeing the subtext of the ‘stereotype of the evil whites’ is an understandable audience reaction.)

There’s a saying in writing circles that you should ‘show, don’t tell’ when you write. This means that an author should strive to demonstrate an aspect of plot or characterization through subtext as opposed to text.

This narrative doesn’t follow the methodology of ‘show don’t tell’ very often. Kuang is an author who uses themes/motifs of decolonialist literature. The ‘show don’t tell’ rule is a Western rule, originating during the Cold War and spread abroad as a method to counter the more didactic cultural communism literary tradition the Soviet Union was spreading. (I’m serious, that really happened.) Perhaps the author made the artistic choice to bring the decolonialist message into the storytelling itself. That’s good! ‘Tell, don’t show’ is a legitimate storytelling style.

... however, we readers are allowed to critique a book about things we don’t like, even if they are a legitimate storytelling style. Some people don’t like 2nd person fiction. Others don’t like Tolkien’s poems and songs. I dislike how flat this novel’s ‘tell, don’t show’ storytelling style is.

There is a middle ground between ‘tell, don’t show’ and ‘show, don’t tell.’ ‘Babel’ used ‘tell, don’t show’ to tell a political message about racism. That’s a good message! Some readers won’t notice a political message in their books if the message isn’t shoved down their throat. However, ‘show, don’t tell’ and ‘tell, don’t show’ are NOT mutually exclusive. An author trying to appeal to a broad audience will use BOTH ‘show don’t tell’ and ‘tell don’t show’ in their book, layering them together like an onion to provide more and more layers the closer you look at a book.

If I were to summarize my thoughts on this book, I’d say it’s good at critiquing history, as good as or better than anything else I’ve read in the genre. But the actual story going on here was a bit dull.

To me the book just fails on a messaging level once it gets past the ""DID YOU KNOW COLONIALISM IS BAD?!"" stage, because Kuang doesn\'t seem like she has much else to say on the matter, and it\'s not like there isn\'t anything else to say...', ""As a mixed race Brit what I found inexcusable was the fact that Kuang  didn't even try to address the rampant anti-black racism that would have existed among South East and East Asian communities back then.

Her entire approach to racism was lazy and the worst kind of pandering."", 'Kuang’s books tend to lack deep analysis in my opinion. I recently read Yellowface by her and I thought it would be a great deep dive into racism and classism in publishing but it read like a chronically online work about the criticisms levied towards her as being an extremely privileged author, that despite being a POC she would not have had access to if she did not come from a wealthy background. She takes those criticisms and just pretends they are from crazy “Karen’s” like her protagonist instead of having a thoughtful look at the part privilege plays in the publishing industry.']",0.03354299585506873,0.45047193378628453,1
Alcoholic drinks and black tea being used as a tool for Mass Control? Here is how..,188,conspiracy,https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/19970mi/alcoholic_drinks_and_black_tea_being_used_as_a/,1705523828.0,"Disclaimer: If you enjoy drinking alcohol or black tea please don't take this post personal. Also sadly this is not a conspiracy.. 

**What is ""Third eye""?**

Popular definition: It is another name for the pineal gland, a part of your brain that has a number of cells that are similar to those found in the eye.

https://preview.redd.it/d6ogfry373dc1.jpg?width=393&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=e7acc389ea7c23a5fc10c204cd6ad1b75d500dfa

Spiritual definition: Ajna (third eye) chakra is said to be in the same location as the pineal gland and is seen as the source of visions and other psychic and/or metaphysical abilities and source of intuitive knowing.

**What are the functions of the pineal gland?**

Scientifically accepted function is to receive information about the state of the light-dark cycle from the environment and convey this information by the production and secretion of the hormone melatonin.

What this definition doesn't mention is the production of DMT.

https://preview.redd.it/fluxgge642dc1.jpg?width=262&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=47d13f443bb7941ccf2503ce8bae4758a8d209cf

In addition to producing melatonin, the pineal gland also produces extremely tiny amounts of N,N-dimethyltryptamine (DMT), a potent psychedelic. While it has been proposed that the pineal gland excretes large quantities of DMT during extremely stressful life episodes, notably in the event of birth and death, to produce “out of body” experiences.

The French philosopher, mathematician, and scientist, Descartes regarded the pineal gland as the principal seat of the soul and the place in which all thoughts are formed.

**What is pineal gland calcification?**

Scientifically accepted definition is that calcification can prevent your pineal gland from functioning properly. Some studies have revealed that the degree of calcification of the pineal gland is higher in those affected by Alzheimer's disease. This gland has the highest calcification rate among all organs and tissues of the human body. Pineal gland calcification is thought to jeopardize the amount of melatonin (and DMT) that can be produced by the gland and may be associated with a variety of neuronal diseases and **linked to fluoride** in our tap water and toothpaste like products and **linked to chlorine** mainly in tap water and public pools.

***!!***

Because of the calcification, your third eye, symbol of intuitive knowing, may be blocked physically.

This could make you more susceptible to accepting false truths and defending them when challenged about the possibility of deception.

**Are there other toxic effects of fluoride on us?**

High exposure to fluoride was reported to be associated with **infertility** in men.

High fluoride intake is associated with **reduced IQ** and **increased weight gain** in adults.

In one study, rats were kept under low-fluoride conditions for several generations, which led to decreased excessive weight gain and increased body movement activities.

**How are these related to alcoholic drinks?**

Did you know most common alcoholic drinks especially beer and wine has super high amounts of fluoride content in them?

https://preview.redd.it/lcefst0b92dc1.jpg?width=138&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=7822dc0ac7733421f5637dbd4e67d726c36b4af9

White wine can have **2000x** and regular beer can have **440x** the recommended fluoride amount that is allowed in drinking water!

The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services recommends a level of 0.7 milligrams per Liter (mg/L) which is **(0.07 mg/100 g)** of fluoride in your drinking water.

The United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) data from 2004 show the lowest fluoride levels in spirits **(9 mg/100 g)**, including vodka, rum, gin, and whiskey

The same data shows higher levels of fluoride in regular beers **(44 mg/100 g)**, lagers **(45 mg/100 g)**, red wines **(105 mg/100 g)**, and white wines **(202 mg/100 g)**

[source](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4856716/)

**How are these related to black tea?**

Black tea has the highest content of fluoride out of all other tea types up to **(20 mg/100 g)** **which is 200x** the recommended fluoride amount that is allowed in drinking water where as mint tea has (0.6 mg/100 g).

https://preview.redd.it/8tu5qr1qa2dc1.jpg?width=280&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=d0a7366fca16397125dbf0eca1388571237d7ca1

Lower levels of fluoride was observed in oolong (0.11 mg/100g) and green tea (0.13 mg/100g).

In Ireland, the higher exposure of adults was predominantly due to fluoride consumption by black tea that contributed approximately 76% of the total exposure.

*The Diddly Squatters are back for series three of* Clarkson’s Farm *— with pigs, Jeremy’s new hovercraft and the most thrilling rows with the local council yet! Plus Jeremy on his favourite farm machines*

Interview by Tom Barnes (*The Sunday Times*, April 7) \[very mild spoilers\]

He once claimed his only talents were driving fast round corners and shouting, but as a pig farmer Jeremy Clarkson has found his calling. He has changed the nickname of his Oxfordshire farm from Diddly Squat to Piggly Squat in honour of his new herd of swine and he’s cuddling one now as he poses for a photographer, whispering to it — not shouting — as if it’s auditioning for *Babe*. “Pigs are my favourite animals we’ve had on the farm by a long way,” he coos to the animal, a female. “I know that cows are great, but pigs are easier to manage and very endearing.”

https://preview.redd.it/bsjfqsyqrbtc1.jpg?width=1200&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=752247848115b8129ff230acaaf89ce08ba47b7a

*Clarkson’s Farm*, the reality show that fuses *Top Gear* and *Countryfile*, is back for a third series with the familiar cast of Clarkson, Kaleb Cooper, newly promoted to farm manager, Lisa Hogan, Clarkson’s girlfriend, the land agent Charlie Ireland and jack of all trades Gerald Cooper. There’ll be more of the usual chaos: including Clarkson going full Robert De Niro with a hunting rifle, taking medicinal mushrooms and crashing farm machinery into stone walls.

It’s six years since Clarkson fled his Notting Hill penthouse to run 1,000 acres of mixed arable and grazing on the edge of the Cotswolds. Back then, his unsuccessful attempts to turn a loss-making venture into a going concern included rearing sheep (it cost him more to shear them than their wool sold for) and beef cows (the council closed his farm restaurant, making it uneconomical to rear them). Now he has turned his hand to pig breeding in a last-ditch attempt to bring home the bacon. “A cow has one calf, whereas the last bout of births we had, one of our pigs had fourteen piglets,” he explains. “That’s a lot of money.”

But life is not all hog heaven. “Behind the scenes everything that could go wrong has gone wrong,” he growls. The hottest June and wettest March in recent history have wrecked his potatoes and spring barley. His ambitious plan to revive a 1960s government scheme to replace tractors with hovercraft for crop spraying and other farm chores was an expensive flop. And he has fallen foul of regulations at every turn.

If it sounds like a litany of disasters, it is — other than it has all added up to one of the biggest TV smashes of the decade so far. In 2019 Amazon commissioned a single season, on a small budget, in anticipation that it might appeal to a niche audience. The *Guardian* called the series “wearisome, meretricious rubbish”, concluding it would be shunned by viewers. It went on to become the UK’s most-watched Amazon-made show. Its series two premiere won 4.3 million viewers, eclipsing the 3.2 million who watched the launch episode of the streaming channel’s biggest investment — a mega-millions Lord of the Rings saga.

Today Clarkson is guiding me round the farm in the spring sunshine, through giant puddles from recent rain. Part of his empire is in an area of outstanding natural beauty, but the soil is not especially fertile or profitable, hence him calling it Diddly Squat in 2018. It lived up to its name, making a surplus of just £114 in its first year. “That’s a thousand acres, working seven days a week,” he says. “It’s all farming pays.”

How does he explain the show’s unexpected success? “It was an enjoyable way of learning about where your food comes from. Because lecturing people doesn’t work. Television is rather obsessed with organic and diversity and sustainability, rather than where food actually comes from and the actual people who make it for you. The Kaleb Coopers and the Geralds and Charlie Ireland and so on. I think it’s been a very useful programme for making people go, ‘Bloody hell, you work very hard doing that and earn no money at all.’”

From the show’s inception Clarkson wanted to reveal the true “mud, blood and barbarism” of life on the land, and pig farming is the starkest example yet. His pigs are a rare Oxfordshire breed called Sandy and Black, misheard by Clarkson as “Shandy and Black” — “sounds like the sort of thing a northern girl would order in a Zante nitespot,” he observed in his Sunday Times farming column.

Spurred on by Liz Truss, who in a speech to the 2014 \[**sic?**\] Conservative Party conference announced she would soon be “in Beijing opening up new pork markets”, Clarkson resolved to seize new export opportunities. He planned to free-graze his pigs in woods where they’d “truffle about turning up acorns”. “Only in an idyllic Winnie the Pooh world,” warned Charlie Ireland, the farm’s resident voice of reason. “Pigs need round-the-clock care.” And so it transpired — as we see from Clarkson’s ham-fisted efforts. There was a high mortality rate among the piglets from his first litters, some of them accidentally crushed by their mothers.

“I reckoned the pigs would provide something that’s sadly lacking in farming today: a bit of genuine happiness,” Clarkson says. “Instead, it was almost unbelievably sad. I’ve never seen Lisa so upset. The film crew looked shellshocked. We had a catastrophically high level of deaths and I was desperately worried we were doing something wrong, but it turned out we weren’t, it was just that pigs are bad mothers — the Sandy and Black particularly so. That’s why it’s a rare breed.”

The series doesn’t flinch from the day-to-day grimness, along with the frustration of creeping red tape, hence it striking a chord with actual farmers.

Robert Martin, 55, a Cumbrian dairy farmer and national chairman of the Tenant Farmers Association, said *Clarkson’s Farm* fairly reflected the daily trials and worries faced by his members. “I do watch it and I do enjoy it. Clarkson said he wanted to increase awareness, especially among people in urban areas who maybe don’t really think about where food comes from. Whether you like Clarkson or you don’t, I think he’s succeeded and he’s done it in an entertaining way.”

George Summers and his father, Michael, farm 460 acres of mixed arable and livestock near Melton Mowbray. “I’ve never watched it on principle,” says Michael, 57, “but I understand there are a lot of people with an entirely contrary view, my son being one.” George, 19, has seen every episode of the first two series and will be watching the third. “It’s very entertaining, even though I think some of it’s done for comedic effect,” he says. “For example, when Clarkson accidentally tipped his tractor up on its back wheels, then got Kaleb to sit at the front as a counterweight, you knew that was unlikely to happen.”

Clarkson and Kaleb jointly won the 2021 Flying the Flag for agriculture award at the British Farming awards. Last May Kaleb was summoned to Downing Street to explain to Rishi Sunak why farmers were struggling — a serious message with a comic edge as Sunak did his best to understand Kaleb’s rural brogue. Ireland was there too, admonishing officials over all the form-filling devised by Whitehall. “You do need a PhD in grant applications if you’re a farmer,” he scolded them.

If there’s a narrative thread it’s Clarkson’s own journey from innocent abroad in series one — Billy Crystal in *City Slickers*, if you like — to horny-handed son of the soil. Now he’s less squeamish about sending his animals for slaughter, even though he confessed “I’ve got guilt” as he transported seven pigs to an abattoir. “You’ve got to eat them to save them,” another farmer reassured him. “That enables the survival of the breed.” Still, Clarkson is uncomfortable with the gallows humour of the slaughterhouse. “The butcher will want everything back bar the squeal,” an abattoir worker joked as Clarkson winced. He was determined to brazen it out, declaring, “This time I behaved more like a farmer and didn’t have any unmanly moments,” but the soundman captured the wobble in his voice.

None of it makes sense unless you’re a farmer, Clarkson admits. “You’re up all night nurturing pigs, trying to make them comfortable, trying to make them alive, then you arrive at the farm shop to receive boxes of pork chops and sausages. There’s only one expression that I can think of and it’s ‘farmer’s logic’. All farmers love their animals, then they kill them and sell them.”

In the new series the light relief comes, as ever, in the form of Clarkson’s incompetence with farm machinery — witness his Chaplinesque attempts to harvest nettles, in which he becomes ensnared in the machine and falls into a thicket. He converts an air-sea rescue hovercraft to spray highly corrosive nitrate fertiliser. The dangerous task requires a protective hazmat suit, so he recruits Kaleb to help and chaos ensues as the hovercraft careers out of control.

He’s still in dispute with West Oxfordshire district council, which, as well as closing his restaurant, refused a car park for his farm shop. But now he has powerful allies. Sunak pledged recently to free British farmers from burdensome red tape when converting barns into shops and opening restaurants as a means of reducing dependency on agricultural subsidies.

Under a government-backed rule change widely dubbed “Clarkson’s Law”, farmers will in future no longer need to seek permission from local councils to repurpose farm buildings, making it easier to sell their produce to the public.

Clarkson is delighted but says farming is still overregulated. “If you apply for a grant you have to fill in 2,000 forms and wait for 2,000 years for a man to come in a rented Vauxhall and tell you that you must stop what you’re doing because he has found a bat or some moss.”

We’re now in the kitchen of Clarkson’s hilltop house with sweeping views over sheep-cropped hills and yellow stone houses. His dining room table, as long as a station platform, rests on replicas of the Brunel arches at Paddington station. Recessed into the table top is a Hornby 00 train track. Clarkson shares with Rod Stewart a love of railways. Lisa Hogan is bustling about looking for a model train. “What would you like?” she says, rummaging through Jeremy’s collection. “We have a GWR locomotive, we have the Flying Scotsman.”

From a walk-on part in the first series, Lisa, an Irish-born former actress, has moved nearer to centre stage as she gets to grips with running the farm shop and selling cow juice (milk), bee juice (honey), Jeremy’s Juice (jam) and Jeremy’s Hot Seed (mustard). At one point there’s an unresolved hint of her and Clarkson tying the knot. “I’ve got a big surprise for you,” Clarkson tells her as they walk through a field. “Is it a proposal?” she asks. Clarkson pretends not to hear and shows her the surprise — a fallen willow tree bursting back into life. She presses him. “I’ll think about the proposal, OK? I’m not ready yet.”

When I ask her about the exchange, she laughs. “I just thought I might surprise him.” Did she make a leap-year proposal of her own on February 29? “Jeremy doesn’t think I proposed but he wasn’t wearing his hearing aids, so no one will know.”

*Clarkson’s Farm* is part soap, part serious. One thing it tackles is the problem of soil depletion, which Clarkson warns is a threat to world food supplies as serious as climate change. There may be only “ninety to a hundred harvests left before the topsoil is dead,” he says. The global amount of arable land per person in 2050 will be a quarter of that in 1960, according to the UN, as populations grow and soil degrades. Chemical-heavy farming methods and deforestation are among the culprits.

With this in mind, Clarkson teamed up with Andy Cato, one half of the dance music act Groove Armada and a keen organic farmer, who arrived with a plan to help Clarkson rejuvenate his soil. This involved growing beans and clover in the same field as wheat to boost vital levels of nitrogen. The idea worked better on paper than in practice, but if success is the ability to lurch from one failure to another with no loss of enthusiasm then Clarkson embodies it. Each of his new hare-brained schemes — making soup from nettles, or jam from blackberries sucked from a hedge with a vacuum cleaner, or venison sausages from culled deer, or a pick-me-up from powdered mushrooms — is solemnly appraised by Cheerful Charlie, who turns up like a stern bank manager to put a leash on Clarkson’s enthusiasm and remind him of food safety or stock-rearing regulations.

Clarkson’s instinct is to challenge officialdom in the manner of Kevin Costner’s hard-headed rancher in the TV drama *Yellowstone*. “Let’s fight the f\*\*\*ers and hammer them into the ground like tent pegs,” he says at one point. “I’ve been watching *Yellowstone*. When someone displeases them, they murder them, take them across the state line and throw them in a ravine. I’ve been looking at that scene a lot.”

Is there a danger, I ask, that the series could slip into a cliché of the struggle between honest, hard-working locals and meddling bureaucrats? After all, life in the Cotswolds is hardly a back-breaking slog for many of its well-heeled residents. The list of local luminaries includes the Beckhams, Simon Cowell, David and Samantha Cameron, and Alex James, the cheese-making bassist of Blur.

We catch occasional references to the moneyed set in *Clarkson’s Farm*. Clarkson hatches a plan with Kaleb to sell hay to newly arrived townies who may be planning to keep horses. Meanwhile Lisa tries to entice them by “inviting her thin, blonde Oxfordshire friends over for a spot of goat yoga”, as Clarkson puts it — an exercise class she holds inside a goat pen.

The epicentre of the smart set is Daylesford farm shop — imagine *Country Life* magazine as a retail outlet stocked with wholesome organic produce. Clarkson delights in undercutting his rival’s prices in his own farm shop (“It’s £7 in Daylesford,” he gleefully tells Lisa as he prices his Hot Seed mustard at £6 a jar).

Covid accelerated the exodus of wealth from London. “When I moved to Chipping Norton about 30 years ago it was a small market town with a population of 5,800,” Clarkson says. “Today it’s still a small market town, but the population has skyrocketed to 9,400.” Kaleb admits that spiralling local land prices have put a crimp in his own ambitions. “My eventual goal is to own my own farm,” he tells me. “The only problem is the price of land. Around here the average farm is £3 million.”

If he wasn’t earning money from TV, presenting *Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?* and *The Grand Tour*, and writing newspaper columns, Clarkson says his farm would be under water financially — as well as literally. Thanks to the capriciousness of the weather and geopolitics, farmers never know what’s round the corner. “I’m in the fortunate position of having other income streams,” he says. “If you have two years when you don’t make any money you are screwed. A butterfly can flap its wings in China and you go bankrupt.”

Aside from the knockabout, there’s another side to *Clarkson’s Farm*. It’s as lovingly filmed as an Attenborough wildlife documentary, with lingering shots of hares and deer running through meadows and red kites hovering. There’s a joyful moment when Clarkson’s cows are returned to a meadow from winter captivity. “A lot of the time farming is brutal and hard,” Clarkson says. “But at this time of year, when everything is vivid and growing and bursting with life, and everyone is well, it can be the best job in the world.”

*The first four episodes of series three of* Clarkson’s Farm *are available to watch on Amazon Prime from May 3*

**Clarkson's Favourite Farm Machines**

*JCB Agri Super telehandler, £100,814*

I went for 59 years without a telehandler and I have no idea how. It’s a machine with a telescopic arm that can lift and move heavy loads and is as cool as the kit on Thunderbirds. You will recall from childhood that we had very small straw bales because that was as much as a man could lift. Now they’re much bigger because of the telehandler. Seed comes in half-tonne bags since all farmers have one. They are the Swiss army knives of the farm. I once used it to transport crates of empty bottles, and although it’s me we’re talking about, I didn’t drop one. You can also drive it to the pub. How did the world work before telehandlers?

*Robocut2 RC40 mulching machine, from £45,000*

This may have a top speed of only 2.5mph but it’s a destroyer of worlds. They could have had HS2 built in 20 minutes with one of these. It has tracks and a snazzy yellow paint job, but it’s not much bigger than a kitchen table and has a tiny diesel engine, so it’s as fast as an earwig. Plus it’s radio- controlled, so there are complex electronics, which is just what you don’t want in a big wet wood. But it works. On the front there’s a rotating drum, studded with steel spiky bits. I used it to clear brambles by the pond and two minutes after starting the engine they were dust. I’ve never encountered a machine that does so efficiently what it sets out to do.

*Kokan berry harvester 500S, £156,000*

A brilliant machine but we couldn’t make it work. You had to get it to straddle a hedge, but to reach a hedge that was rich in blackberries first we had to get it down 200 yards of stone wall. The wall is still destroyed as a result, so that was a bit of a disaster. Most of my hedges proved too big and thick because I let them grow wild to attract insects and birds.

*Kobelco mini-excavator, from £53,000*

I don’t think there’s a man alive who wouldn’t have fun with a digger. Go and make a pond. No, make a trench. There was a wonderful moment while we were building the farm shop car park when Lisa was using the road roller, Gerald was on the tractor and Kaleb and I were excavating. The full Avengers Assembled. I love days like that.

*Lamborghini R8 270 tractor, £40,000*

I quite wanted a Fendt tractor, but they are expensive and I’m from Yorkshire. The R8 was only £40,000 second-hand, but it has 48 gears and 188 buttons and it’s impossible to remember what all of them do. It’s also huge. It was too big for my barn, so I had to build a new one. Even the front tyres are taller than me. I said when I got it that if a Lamborghini Aventador made love to a spaceship, this is what you’d end up with. I’ve never been terrified at 25mph before, but when I first drove it I really was. At the start I didn’t complete a single job without at least one crash, but I’ve got the hang of driving it.

*Nettle harvester, from £230*

Half my farm is brambles and nettles, so I came up with a plan to harvest the nettles for soup. At first I tried the same machines they use for harvesting tea, but it was suspended from my shoulders, so my back was soon in agony. Then I switched to a bigger device with a hedge-cutter underneath and a fan for blowing the leaves into a collecting bag. It was good at hoovering up the top leaves but it also harvested the stalks as well as twigs, dead mice and everything else on the forest floor. While I might get people to try soup made from nettles, they would shy away from a label saying, “May contain traces of deer faeces”.

*K Two Bio 1600 muck spreader, from £66,000*

That thing had the power of a Gatling gun. You could load it with gravel and drive it through a war zone. Actually, you could just leave it full of cow manure. No soldier is going to like being hit in the face by cow manure doing 150mph. The only problem is that when a stone gets into the muck, as sometimes happens, it gets flung at high speed out of the back. One went 48 metres across a field and somebody’s garden, through their sitting room window, ripped a hole in their sofa, went into their kitchen, hit the fridge door and broke it.

*Protech P200S post-driver, from £6,950*

Until these hydraulic post-knockers came along you had to use a manual one, nicknamed a “man killer”. There’s nothing that wears you out more than manually knocking in a fencepost, particularly around here where the ground is 90 per cent stone. So the hydraulic machine is a very good invention, although it’s also a scary-looking thing. It could be used in Gangs of Chipping Norton. This really would break you in half. But we got all the fences done — not terribly well, but we did a pretty good job.

*Supacat ATMP 6×6, £9,000*

I went to a sale of ex-army equipment and saw the Supacat. I think it was £9,000. The army used them to rescue Snatch Land Rovers that had broken down or been blown up in the desert in Afghanistan or Iraq. I thought, “That’ll be very useful on the farm.” With it having not stopped raining since December 8, it’s useful because it has big, fat, soft tyres. It doesn’t get stuck or damage the earth. It has no roof, number plates or suspension, so it’s no good on the M40, but around the farm it’s ideal. No matter what the weather’s doing I can fire up the Supacat, attach the trailer using an extremely manly Nato hitch and head off for firewood.

*BHC twin-engine hovercraft, from £25,000*

I like hovercrafts and this one was a lovely former air-sea rescue machine. We tried it for crop spraying. A tractor leaves wheel ruts in a field where nothing grows afterwards, but a hovercraft doesn’t, so you get better coverage. The trouble was, it couldn’t cope with any kind of gradient or, as it turned out, any kind of weight in terms of the liquid fertiliser spray. So you set off and after a minute you had to come back and refill it with nitrate fertiliser. I think it would have needed 75 refills to do one field, so it would have taken Kaleb all day. Also, he fell off. So, tragically, the hovercraft was abandoned.","['Who wants to watch things go right for Clarkson?', 'Look, I just want to know how Pepper is doing.', 'The fact that the guardian thought this show would flop like crazy and would be shunned by audience to season 2 premier overtaking LoTR is a crazy turn and I love it!']",0.0976587690886252,0.4751198911001071,1

So it reduced their quantity/quality of other nations/countries that didn't have access to such compensations. Decreasing their overall Human Capital, competitiveness, success. And by this, relatively, rising Russia owns, mainly purchased/taken from the West.

|||| 20-21st centuries western mistakes related to USSR/Russia: ||||

1. 1920-1930s: USSR industrialization/militarization, despite Lenin's rhetoric about the World Revolution and ""Soviet power = unlimited violence."" During Soviet-Germany bypassing of Treaty of Versailles.
2. Nuremberg Trial ban on soviet criticism. Distortion of WW2, extremely expensive, historical lessons and creation of too weak vaccine against WW1/WW2 root causes.
3. 1945-1960s: Abysmal informational security, that could be solved by mass popularization of skepticism/rationalism knowledge. By publicity. But instead of opening Soviet archives, especially after 1969 year, USA started ""fight fire with fire"" - by using NKVD-like Political Realism, total secrecy, attempts to subjugate even democratic countries, etc.
4. 1970-1980s: Purchase of Soviet natural resources and selling to USSR western technologies (\~KAMAZ).
5. 1990s: Still closed soviet archives. And, by Budapest Memorandum (take away third nuclear arsenal with threats of sanctions and false promises), and Political Realists logic, transforming Russia from ordinary country to some ""regional superpower"" with ""areas/spheres of influence"", that outright violated Letter and Spirit of main International Law agreements.
6. Not so much start of Iraq war (against regime that killed up to 290,000 people), but subsequent investment of enormous money in everything, except most essential - education. By which USA could turn Iraq, Afghanistan, Libya in second Japan, Germany, South Korea, but spent trillions of dollars on nothing. Discredit itself as Global Policeman.
7. Trade with authoritarian countries and naïve belief that increase in education, living standards, economic ties, and globalization overall are universal answer. When part of given to authoritarian countries economic and technological resources (only to Russia $8,000B) were used by them to reduce/adapt/distort globalization and Information Age processes. Mix of Kissinger's Political Realism greed with Neville Chamberlain's pacification fear.
8. 2008-2021 years pacification policies - ignore/fear of Russian WMD-blackmail. That allowed Russia with impunity violate dozens of international agreements and prove superiority of ""WMD-Might make Right/True"" logic/strategy over International Law.
   1. ""De-escalation"" ignore of 2008 (Russian reset) and 2014 (drop of oil price, Obama's ""Western sanctions had left Russia isolated and its economy in ruins"", anti-Ukraine arms embargo) years occupations.
   2. In 2021 year, Russia publicly announced its claim on West Europe... And the West responded by assurances that if Russia will start war in Ukraine, it wouldn't interfere.
   3. For Russia ""any impunity is a drug, and any manifestation of weakness - new temptation for escalation."" And in 2008-2024 years the West only and did that dispense endless impunity and self-victimization. Escalating via ""de-escalation.""
   4. 2022-2023 years, ""bleeding Russia"" stabilization/de-escalation strategy, to ""reduce short-term risks"", gave Russia time to adapt to war, create more chaos in the World, critically lower USA/Western Trust Capital, start mass produce Status-6 nuclear holocaust weapons, begin to form alliance for WW3, etc.
   5. In 2022-2023 years the West, 40% of World's economy and 55% of World's military spending, could:
      1. Give to Ukraine $300B frozen Russian funds.
      2. Create real sanctions: white lists, export restrictions for neighboring Russia countries, confiscation of assets, blockade of Danish and Bosporus straits.
      3. Per year assist Ukraine with the same sum that USA 20 years in row spent on Afghanistan per year - $130B. So that Ukraine could simply buy needed for victory specialists, machine tools, workforce from West.
      4. USA could use 2022 Lend Lease Act or National Emergencies Act or 1950 Defense Production Act, for real Lend Lease (\~$805B) and/or launch of real Arsenal of Democracy. Open all 1920-1960s years soviet archives, conduct a sociological analysis of modern Russian society, and outright say true: ""Nazism is back, and it was created by western censorship about WW2 historical lessons, and by western money.""
      5. USA president could use, not needed congress approval, Excess Defense Articles to transfers old weapons from Sierra Army Depot and 309th AMARG, including 4,5M cluster shells ([www.forbes.com/sites/davidaxe/2024/02/14/joe-biden-could-send-millions-of-artillery-shells-to-ukraine-for-free-tomorrow-and-its-perfectly-legal](https://www.forbes.com/sites/davidaxe/2024/02/14/joe-biden-could-send-millions-of-artillery-shells-to-ukraine-for-free-tomorrow-and-its-perfectly-legal)).
      6. Give significant stocks of western civil aviation/drones and aircraft/moped engines.
      7. Use non-standard solutions: heavily investments into military startups, predominantly so they transform civil aviation/drones to military ones. Adaptation of part of trainer aviation for 600,000 NATO 26-130km glide bombs and \~15,000 long-range missiles. Lease of occupied territories for legal penalties. Fundraisings, peacekeeping contingents, proxy troops, ground launch Tomahawks, real security guarantees, etc.
   6. Instead of this in 2022-2023 years:
      1. USA gave (via replacement financing): 1,2% armored vehicles, 4,1% artillery, 2,6% MLRS, 0% attack drones (UCAV), 0,15% military aviation, 0% military ships, 2,4% air defense.
      2. NATO gave: 0,64% armored vehicles, 6,7% artillery, 4% MLRS, 3,8% attack drones (UCAV), 0,33% military aviation, 0,18% military ships. Predominantly Soviet or most old ones.
      3. During 2 years of war NATO countries spent \~$120B, with up to 2027 year pledges \~$250B (a lot of loans and money for replenish of expired or near-expired weapon stocks; at this point - $272B) relatively to own \~$25,000B budget spendings. Helping on 0,48/1% of own 2-years attention span, less by GDP. Not to mention hundreds of trillions of assets, and allies capabilities.
      4. EU countries imported from Russia on $293B, and EU+NATO countries - on \~$424B (2023 inflation, without Indian hydrocarbons resale). When in 2022-2023 years Russia spent on war \~$211B.

""We should give Ukraine 1 fire extinguisher to weaken fire, but we need 99 others in case fire will jump over on us, because in some places we adding gasoline to save on heating prices"" reality even bigger absurd than 1920-1930s USSR industrialization/militarization and 1938 year Chamberlain's ""Peace for our time.""

As drought dries the great Mississippi River, and saltwater crawls upstream, the U.S. Army has a solution: [**barge in 36M gallons of freshwater**](https://edition.cnn.com/2023/09/23/us/freshwater-new-orleans-saltwater-mississippi-river/index.html) to New Orleans—every day. As the **water crisis** unfolds, American companies are worried that [their mines won’t have enough water](https://www.npr.org/2023/09/26/1192735149/us-needs-copper-lithium-minerals-green-tech-climate-western-mines-enough-water) to function, further complicating our energy transition and collection of minerals.

The UN Food & Agriculture Organization (FAO) released a [352-page report](https://reliefweb.int/report/world/methane-emissions-livestock-and-rice-systems-sources-quantification-mitigation-and-metrics) on methane emissions in livestock and rice production. **Livestock currently generates about 30% of CH4 emissions**, while rice creates around 8%. The most recent IPCC report estimates that methane emissions have contributed about .5 °C to global warming. A German study concluded that [hidden methane leaks](https://scitechdaily.com/scientists-identify-previously-unknown-sources-of-methane-emissions/) (through underground pipelines, “incomplete combustion,” and “fugitive emissions”) are also contributing to this issue.

Switzerland’s glaciers have [lost 10% of volume](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-66950328) over the last two years. Bolivia set [new September heat records](https://reliefweb.int/report/bolivia-plurinational-state/bolivia-hottest-winter-record-ends-drought-more-half-country); last winter was its **hottest on record**. More than 2/3rds of Mexico [is officially in drought](https://mexiconewsdaily.com/news/drought-conditions-now-affect-67-of-mexican-territory/). Parts of Iowa’s crops have [been hard hit](https://www.thegazette.com/agriculture/e-iowa-crops-and-livestock-suffer-through-one-of-the-driest-summers-on-record/) by this year’s **drought**. 

The American power grid [survived a sweltering summer](https://www.vox.com/climate/23893057/power-electricity-grid-heat-wave-record-blackout-outage-climate), but experts fear disaster in the future. In another moment of good news, the [**global rhino population is up**](https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2023/sep/22/rhino-numbers-rebound-as-global-figures-reveal-a-win-for-conservation-aoe) to about 27,000 (including all species of rhinoceros). 

As Germany’s once-legendary economy [is now stalling](https://apnews.com/article/germany-economy-energy-crisis-russia-8a00eebbfab3f20c5c66b1cd85ae84ed) amid energy issues, the public is being confronted with a difficult choice: deindustrialize and go green while losing wealth, or prolong their reliance on fossil fuels to keep the economy chugging along. India is facing [a similar dilemma](https://archive.ph/7TnNU), with the pressure of a rapidly developing population to support.

The UK saw their first “**bomb cyclone**” of the 2023-2024 season [make landfall](https://www.foxweather.com/weather-news/bomb-cyclone-ireland-storm-agnes) last week. Record [temperatures in Australia](https://twitter.com/extremetemps/status/1707343546389319924) and [in eastern Asia](https://twitter.com/extremetemps/status/1707387137685864894). **Coral bleaching** [continues](https://eu.usatoday.com/story/graphics/2023/09/24/coral-bleaching-from-extreme-heat-wave-explained/70647085007/), and some scientists [are using crabs](https://www.vox.com/down-to-earth/2023/9/27/23883039/florida-coral-reef-caribbean-king-crabs-restoration) to combat the coral-killing algae. Over [**100 dolphins died**](https://edition.cnn.com/2023/10/01/americas/amazon-river-dolphins-dead-temperatures-drought-intl-hnk/index.html) from a marine heat wave. Brown bears in Japan [starved](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/sep/26/brown-bear-cubs-in-japan-die-of-starvation-amid-salmon-shortage) to death because of a salmon shortage which researchers blamed on climate change.

A “**global ice emergency**” is looming, based on a 248-page [report](https://reliefweb.int/report/world/water-ice-society-and-ecosystems-hindu-kush-himalaya-outlook) about the Hindu Kush river basins. The region contains more ice than anywhere on earth, except the North & South Poles, and it’s making its final journey out. Peak Water for the region is expected by mid-century, with decreasing amounts from there onward. The loss of the cryosphere will result in the dieoff of countless local species. The Hindu Kush Himalayas are experiencing a **temperature rise of 0.28 °C per decade**. Roughly 130M farmers depend on regional meltwater for irrigation. The [world water crisis](https://www.project-syndicate.org/commentary/extractive-capitalism-and-the-global-water-crisis-by-joshua-castellino-2023-09) is still in its early stages…

**Flash flooding** [struck New York City](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-66965396), dropping 8 inches (20 cm) in a day. Subway stations were flooded, and a terminal at LaGuardia airport was forced to close for a day. An unprecedented [heat wave](https://twitter.com/extremetemps/status/1706652849734664620/photo/1) struck Central & Eastern Europe. 

The data is in: [**Antarctica suffered the greatest heat wave**](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/9/25/report-says-antarctica-witnessed-worlds-most-intense-heatwave-in-2022) **of 2022**. It happened in March 2022, when temperatures rose **44 °C above normal**. Scientists say that the warm air from Australia reached Antarctica for “probably the first time that at least it’s happened that fast.”  Heat waves are expected [to continue into October](https://www.severe-weather.eu/global-weather/heatwave-forecast-europe-unseasonably-warm-heat-dome-october-autumn-season-2023-mk/) in Europe.

Around 1,000 people [died from **dengue in Bangladesh**](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-66944315) in the last few weeks. Dengue fever is spread by mosquitoes, and globally has a CFR of less than 1%—but allegedly there is a stronger strain circulating in Bangladesh. Dengue deaths this year have eclipsed dengue deaths in recent decades in the country. Rising temperatures, rain patterns, and sanitation problems have extended the dengue season longer than it was previously. Cholera and dengue [are rising](https://english.alarabiya.net/News/middle-east/2023/09/26/Cholera-and-dengue-outbreaks-reported-in-eastern-Sudan-as-conflict-grinds-on-UN) in Sudan. 

[**Diphtheria has come to Nigeria**](https://reliefweb.int/report/nigeria/unicef-nigeria-raises-alarm-over-unprecedented-diphtheria-outbreak-urges-urgent-vaccination), where it has [slain 453 people](https://www.turkiyenewspaper.com/world/16507) in the last 10 months. UNICEF sent 9M+ vaccines There have been 7,000+ confirmed cases and thousands of suspected cases. Diphtheria is a bacterial infection transmitted through contact or through the air, and has a CFR of between 5-20%.

[**Food inflation**](https://archive.ph/xYp0c) lingers, especially in poorer nations. Some bankers [are saying](https://www.theguardian.com/business/2023/sep/24/banking-regulator-sam-woods-this-is-the-most-intense-period-since-the-2008-financial-crisis) “**this is the most intense period” in world economics since the 2008-2009 financial crisis**. 

The ongoing **diesel shortage** is theorized by some to [lead to a worldwide economic crisis](https://www.asiamarkets.com/diesel-fuel-shortages-could-lead-to-a-global-economic-crisis-within-months/) in just a few months. The U.S. strategic reserve of petroleum has yet to be replenished from last year, when about half of it was consumed to pressure prices down. 

What will happen when [China hits Peak Oil](https://archive.ph/RlzSv)? Some expect China to cross this point later in 2023, moving forward to a future more heavily dependent on coal and renewable energy. **Coal currently accounts for 56% of China’s energy** consumption; oil is 26%. 

A pestilential mite, deadly for bees, was discovered in Australia in June 2022. Since then, over 100M AUD has been committed to eradicate the plague. The government has now announced that [its spread is uncontainable](https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2023/sep/20/varoa-bee-killing-mite-australia-eradication-abandoned-why), and **cannot be eradicated**. The nation’s pollinators (and all whom they support) may be living on borrowed time. 

A 157-page [report on global maritime shipping](https://unctad.org/system/files/official-document/rmt2023_en.pdf) was released last week. Over 80% of global trade uses the seas & oceans. After a dip in total trade volume last year, a small increase has been achieved so far in 2023. The industry is still unsure how it can successfully decarbonize while trade demand grows. I did not have time to process this report, but it’s got a lot of useful graphics.

As **Iran edges closer to achieving the Bomb**, Saudi Arabia claims [**it wants nuclear weapons**](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/sep/21/crown-prince-confirms-saudi-arabia-seek-nuclear-arsenal-iran-develops-one) if Iran has them. Regardless, Saudi Arabia has [announced](https://www.cnbc.com/2023/09/26/saudi-arabia-announces-step-forward-in-its-nascent-nuclear-power-plans.html) its intent to construct a nuclear power program—though it has not yet indicated where the power plants might be. 

30 Serbian terror suspects [battled Kosovo police](https://edition.cnn.com/2023/09/24/europe/kosovo-shootout-police-officer-dead-intl/index.html) in a monastery in northern Kosovo, leading NATO to commit more troops to keep the fragile “peace.” Sweden is experiencing [**record gun deaths**](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/sep/28/sweden-records-record-high-number-of-shooting-deaths-in-september) since records began 7 years ago. The Republican-controlled U.S. House of Representatives [has begun an impeachment inquiry](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-66944114) into President Biden. 

Tensions are [growing](https://archive.ph/HW43E) over a migrant shelter in Chicago. A similar sentiment [is boiling over](https://www.npr.org/2023/09/27/1201878358/migrants-staten-island-anti-immigration-protests-newyork) in Staten Island, New York. In Europe, **green politics are being** [**derailed by populism**](https://www.politico.eu/article/discontent-eu-green-deal-climate-change-backlash/) and dependence on old economic models. A [warehouse blew up](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/9/28/powerful-blast-near-uzbekistans-tashkent-airport-kills-one-injures-162) in Tashkent, killing one and injuring 162. 

**Gang warfare in northern Mexico** led to [a dozen mutilated bodies dumped in public](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-latin-america-66911902). Kenya’s plan to [lead a 1,000-person strong force](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-africa-66946156) to stabilize Haiti is expected to land by the end of this year; a few other nations have joined. Taiwan [revealed its first domestically-produced submarine](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-66932808) ahead of rising Taiwan-China tensions; it is expected to be officially launched by the end of next year. In Gaza, [rising tensions](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-66950112) are said to be “boiling” because of closed roads, unemployment, weapons, and financial instability. 

The **Organized Crime Index for 2023** [dropped](https://ocindex.net/report/2023/0-3-contents.html) last week, though it only covers 2022. During that year, 4% more people lived in areas affected by “high levels of criminality.” Their reporting found that human trafficking and financial crimes were the “most prevalent criminal market.”

**Mali, Burkina Faso, and Niger have made a defensive alliance** ahead of a potential ECOWAS intervention. Without friends, [Burkina Faso is growing closer](https://www.opendemocracy.net/en/odr/burkina-faso-wagner-sahel-security-jihadist/) to the Wagner Group. Burkina Faso also allegedly [**foiled a coup** attempt](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-africa-66945023a) on Tuesday.

After months of blockade from Azerbaijan, the ethnically-Armenian separatist enclave [**Nagorno-Karabakh will dissolve its government**](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/sep/28/nagorno-karabakh-separatist-government-says-dissolve-azerbaijan-armenia) and yield its claims to independence. In 3 months, the territory [will be fully incorporated into Azerbaijan](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-66945481). Their will to resist was crushed essentially by **severe hunger and supply shortages**. 

A “vigilante” group operating against illegal immigrants has [registered as a political party](https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2023/sep/26/south-africa-anti-migrant-vigilante-operation-dudula-registers-as-party-2024-elections) in South Africa. In northern Africa, [**Tunisian pushbacks continue**](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/sep/28/tunisia-border-africans-forced-into-desert-eu-deal-europe-violent-treatment) to force migrants/refugees to the Libyan border. One NGO estimates that this year 50-70 people have died of thirst as a result.

A suicide bomber in Pakistan [killed 52 people](https://archive.ph/s3q5j) last week; another suicide bomber killed 5 elsewhere in Pakistan. 

The EU has [crossed a tipping point](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/sep/30/ukraine-russia-war-changed-eu) in the War in Ukraine. Allegedly Ukraine [asked western allies](https://www.ynetnews.com/article/sy8h50ge6) to strike **drone-production facilities in Syria** which were supplying Russia with drones. Ukrainian drones [attacked a substation](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/9/29/russian-power-substation-hit-in-latest-ukrainian-drone-wave-attack) in Russia. If you believe the rumors, Putin is allegedly [trying to run the War himself](https://www.businessinsider.com/putin-is-making-war-decisions-on-own-surprisingly-cautious-2023-9), and making cautious decisions against his generals’ advice.

It's Not Her Choice—She Has Been Conditioned To Think That Way,99,librandu,https://www.reddit.com/r/librandu/comments/1grtxmr/its_not_her_choiceshe_has_been_conditioned_to/,1731668704.0,"A few days ago, two posts were made on r\librandu about hijab/burqa. People raised some very valid points there. This is my attempt at countering those points, and I have decided to share them with y'all.

I did not touch on the comparison with sati as I find it to be quite a heavy topic and it doesn't fit into the themes of counter points I am raising.

Here are those posts for reference:

# It's not their choice—they have been conditioned to think that way.

Say, you are a huge Spider-Man fan—and you see some Spider-Man clothing and you decide to buy it. Well, is it really your choice?—or are you just conditioned to think that way—all that time you spent on those fandom chat boards must've had some effect on you—it might have nudged you into liking stuff like these; had you not spent time in that fandom—you probably wouldn't have bought that T-shirt. Now, imagine someone comes along and forcefully asks you to remove that Spider-Man T-shirt—saying that they want to safeguard your freedom of choice—that you never had the freedom in the first place—that you were ""brainwashed"" into liking these things from all the time you spent in that fandom. How would you feel?

Most of what we do is conditioned—our mannerisms—our way of speaking—our way of writing—what clothes we wear; the spicy food, we Indians are so proud of, is the consequence of India being a hot country—thus requiring the need to spice our food as a means of preserving it; when we say that we like spicy food—is that really our choice?—or are we conditioned to think that way by the cosmic dice at play? Heck, even our genetics—what we find intetesting and not interesting are determined to an extent by our genes and our environment we grew up in; when Samrita says that she want to become a doctor—is it really her choice at play—or is it the effect of being brought up in a home where both of her parents are doctors—and medicine is revered as a profession? We can drag this further—which gender we are attracted to is determined by our hormones and shaped by our environmnet—heteronormativity, which we should totally get rid off. And even after doing all that—who we will fall in love with will heavily depend on on our brain chemistry and our environment. So, you wanting to stay with your SO—is it really your choice?—or were you conditioned to think that way?

Is choosing to wear saree not cultural conditioning? Is choosing to wear a turban not cultural conditioning? Office apparals—which are mandated and pushed by our coorporate culture—is that not cultural conditioning?

Policing people's freedom of choice is a futile task, and it takes away whatever semblance of agency (or illusion of it) that they may have had. While playing Ludo—or any kind of dice game—people don't usually like it when someone else (exceptions—loved ones—""lucky people"") rolls their dice—even though it has no effect on the outcome. You may walk them through all the factors affecting their choice, so that they can make a better decision. But to belittle people, or as in this case, to outright strip their right to wear what they want under the pretext of ""safeguarding their freedom of choice,"" is a little sadistic to me.

# Veiling is rooted in misogyny.

Halloween’s roots trace back to the ancient Celtic festival of Samhain (pronounced “sow-in”), celebrated over 2,000 years ago in what is now Ireland, Scotland, and parts of Britain. Samhain marked the end of the harvest season and the beginning of winter, a time associated with death and the supernatural. The Celts believed that during Samhain, the boundary between the living and the dead became thin, and the spirits of the deceased could return to the world of the living. This made it a time for honoring ancestors, but also a time when people feared that malevolent spirits could cause harm. To appease these spirits, the Celts would offer sacrifices and food, and light bonfires to guide the spirits. To protect themselves from these wandering spirits, people wore costumes and masks to disguise themselves as fellow spirits or to scare away evil ones. This is one of the traditions that evolved into the modern practice of dressing up for Halloween. Bonfires were central to Samhain, as they were believed to purify and protect people from evil spirits. People also offered sacrifices, both animal and sometimes crops, to the spirits of the dead, hoping to ensure a good harvest in the coming year.

But—the meaning has changed—what was once seen with reverence and fear is now seen with a sense of celebration and fun. Originally, jeans were associated with the working class and the poor. Youth culture in the 1950s, inspired by rebellious icons like James Dean and Marlon Brando, began wearing jeans as a symbol of defiance and individuality. Over time, jeans evolved into a global fashion staple worn by people from all social classes. Veiling was historically considered a status symbol in many societies and was often associated with the upper classes. In several ancient and medieval cultures, veiling signified wealth, modesty, and exclusivity, as it marked women who were privileged enough not to engage in physical labor or be exposed to the public. Here are a few examples. (Pulled from ChatGPT)

1. Mesopotamia: In ancient Assyria, veiling was a privilege reserved for noblewomen, and laws even forbade slaves and prostitutes from wearing veils, reinforcing its association with status and respectability.
2. Ancient Greece and Rome: Elite women often used veils to signify modesty and virtue. Veiling distinguished them from lower-class women who had no such societal expectations or rights.
3. Byzantine Empire: Wealthy women and royalty commonly wore veils as part of their elaborate attire, showcasing their rank and seclusion.
4. Islamic Societies: In early Islamic history, veiling (hijab) was often adopted by wealthy and aristocratic women, imitating Persian and Byzantine customs. It symbolized both religious piety and social status, as poorer women or slaves were less likely to veil.
5. Victorian England: While not full veils, face-covering accessories like veiled hats were popular among the upper classes during the 19th century, symbolizing refinement and social distinction.

We have seen the 💀 emoji change meaning right in our own lifetime. Cultures are never static; they are always evolving in our ever-changing world. Especially in our post-industrial world.

Likewise—veiling—which was once a symbol of misogyny has taken on a new meaning—that of—identity—culture—and fashion (this bit always riles up the conservative mullahs, which is always fun to watch, ngl); and in Indian context—an act of resistance—a form of cultural defiance against the right-wing government—which wants to...you know. The government's attempt to ban hijab has only springboarded its adoption—with many people embracing it as a form of cultural and political autonomy. For many people—mostly rich, educated Muslims—veiling is a choice—and they choose it for various reasons, like to come closer to their faith or due to social anxiety. The veil has also become a symbol of femininity—many Muslim trans women also veil—they are not being oppressed into doing it. Which brings us to oppression—what I said above mostly applies to privileged people who actually do have a choice (who often flip-flop between Western clothes and hijab); for them, veiling does not signify oppression—but many are not that fortunate. For many—veiling still retains its misogynistic character—cultures are not monolithic.

# Veiling is oppressive to some—especially to those in the lower socioeconomic strata.

Say, Mumtaz grew up in city with a poor, conservative family—there were strict restrictions put on her—she was not allowed to talk to boys in her area—she was only allowed to go out with her sisters or her mother—values of honor and modesty were ingrained into her mind right from her childhood; her cousins constantly bully her if her hair seeps through hijab; her family follows religion as a means of ""escaping the wrath of God."" Many often tend to forget that people's relationship with God is transactional (some of the earliest gods of agricultural humans were harvest gods)—motivated by fears and anxieties brought on by the insecurities of their lives—this fear often manifests itself as the fear of eternal damnation in Christianity and Islam. Fear (or the lack of it) is also a big reason why people often let go of their religion once their material conditions are met. Why do you think atheism has only exploded recently—were the people of the bygone era stupid? Why do you think that explosion is limited to (mostly) Western countries—are people of the global south stupid? Many atheist right-wingers think so (and their numbers have only increased); this is not the first time the ideas of progressiveness are used to justify bigotry; they were also used during the segregation era—Whites were deemd progressive and civilized, whereas Blacks were deemed regressive and uncultured; the British also used similar reasoning to justify their exploitation of Indians; and now—the atheism sub (the big one) has become an apolegia for Israeli war crimes. They use a similiar reasoning—Arabs are religious and regressive, therefore deserve to be bombed; and we, Indians, have adopted a similar attitude—veiled women are regressive, therefore don't deserve education. When we think about it—our bigotry has not changed—it has only shifted form; earlier, we discrimimated on the basis of racial superiority—now, we discriminate on the basis of progressiveness, whithout ever acknowledging that racial differences in the past and regressiveness in the present both stem from harsh material conditions. White supramacists continue to use the progressivism of Western Civilization—a dog whistle for White Power—to channel their bigotry.

Mumtaz's father had planned to get her married right after her class 10th exam, but after getting really good marks—she and her family persuaded her father to continue her education in a girls-only junior collage, where hijab was allowed; her sisters were not as fortunate—they were married right after their class 10th exam. She completed her class 12th exam with really good marks and now wants to pursue graduation. Her father is, of course, highly reluctant to this—he keeps up the news: he knows how right-wing thugs harass Muslim girls. A relative also suggested that she was possessed by a demonic jinn for wanting to go to college. By the way—Mumtaz also veils. The oppression faced by Muslim women, like all women, is multifaceted. It is almost laughable that many people, especially those on the left, brush all of that aside, and make hijab a focal point for playing identity politics. The terms of discourse are set by the BJP, and many on the left are sleepwalking right into the trap of identity politics.

Say, you want to confront Mumtaz's father—how would you do it? Would you tell him that what he had been believing—his religion—is all just made up? Which it is—don't get me wrong—but people, especially old people, are too ingrained in their ways to change course this late in their life. Also, this will raise massive red flags in his mind—he will never send his daughter to college if he suspects there is any possibility of her turning into an atheist. He only has good interests of his daughter in mind—because from his perspective—he is saving her from eternal damnation—and her not going to college is a small price to pay. Hardline approach seems like a bad idea when your goal is to help people—shocker! How about instead you give out a helping hand. How about instead of ostracizing him and patronizing him, you give him a ground of empathy to stand on and feel safe. To say that you will always be there to defend the rights and identity of his daughter. People are more willing go listen when you talk to them on their level. I say this because many ""rational"" atheists often employ a condescending tone when talking to ""irrational"" religious people—reminiscent of how ""civilized"" Whites would speak to ""uncivilized"" Blacks. I have also gone through the edgy atheist phase—I feel nothing but shame when I look back at myself.

Mumtaz completes her graduation, gets married and has a girl child. She is much, much less restrictive to her child because she has seen the horrors of conformity—both internal and external—firsthand.

This clash between Mumtaz and her father may seem like a cozy melancholic story to us, but to many, it is a horrid reality. That jinn part is something I have seen happen with a friend of my friend—in that same context. It is highly ironic that we, as leftists, who are against class discrimination often end up discriminating on the basis of religiosity, which is one of the best markers of class. Religion is a drug; and just like drugs—religion is a symptom of deeper societal problems. To strike at religion itself is to target symptoms—which does nothing but set the stage for more identity politics. Like drugs, we cannot stop it at the supply end. We need to strike at the heart of the issue—unjust material conditions—which make the adoption of religion inevitable.

# Why don't men wear burqa?

Effeminophobia: An irrational fear or aversion toward traits, behaviors, or expressions associated with femininity, especially as exhibited by men; a social or psychological discomfort with qualities that are stereotypically perceived as feminine.

The same reason why men are so averse to wearing bangles, even though bangles don't carry that oppressive connotation with it—at least not in our time.

It is because of its effiminate connotation—burqa is embraced by a lot of Muslim trans women—that doesn't seem oppression to me.

Why don't men wear skirts—we never question that. Are men not choosing to wear skirts their own choice or just cultural conditioning? Men should have more varied clothing options, right? How would you feel if someone came along and asked your father to strip his regressive attire for a nice skirt? All the while standing on a moral high ground—patronizing him how it was not his choice in the first place—sounds pretty sadistic, right? Because it is, and that's how Muslim women feel when asked to take off their burqa after having worn them for a long time. You are, from their perspective, stripping them naked.

To withhold education and work from people unless they UNWILLINGLY conform to your notions of progressivism is the textbook definition of sadism. It is all the more ironic given that education and financial independence can actually help them move beyond their regressiveness through exposure to different cultures and different perspectives. 
","['I’ve seen toddlers in hijabs, how is it a choice when you wear it all your life, are made to believe that your acceptance lies in it and see all women wearing it around you? The privileged elite women who “choose” to wear to fit in and supposedly escape harassment, or to garner some social media likes as an adult are a total and complete waste of education. There’s an entire organization called faithless hijabi detailing the atrocities like honour killing that women who choose to defy these dogmas are subjected to.', ""Obviously, most libs agree that there shouldn't be a ban on wearing burqa/hijab. \n\nWhat they actually mean is, feminism is not about supporting/praising individual choices a woman makes. A woman is going to make a thousand choices everyday, some for survival, some to rebel and sometimes to just get along with the flow. One cannot expect every choice of theirs to be praised, because they are a woman.\n\nWhen someone constantly questions certain choices, people begin to get collective awareness about oppression. And we need more people to question patriarchy."", 'Really comparing apples to oranges with the spiderman cosplay worn at comic cons and burqa whole life when outdoors, while I get your point we have no right policing, but we need to make the bird unlearn and not to love the cage.']",0.0919424628579558,0.44947472715078374,1

What was the early Irish republic like after it's independence?  ,23,IrishHistory,https://www.reddit.com/r/IrishHistory/comments/1fsc0u8/what_was_the_early_irish_republic_like_after_its/,1727636780.0,"I have often heard that Ireland is now one of the world's richest countries, I have read that some of Ireland's development has came around after 1973 when Ireland joined the European Union. I imagine the fact that Ireland was also able to stay out of the chaos of the second world war it was able to develop since it wasn't spending it's money on military or anything related to warfare, I did hear that during the early days of partition the republic was really poor and the six counties taken to form Northern Ireland flourished.

I was curious to know what was the early Irish state like after Britain's withdrawal, I imagine agriculture was the main industry at the time but I really want to learn more about this. I have visited the south, I live in Belfast and when I have been down in the south I can't help but notice that the quality of roads are much better, the architecture looks a bit more modern and the landscapes are shockingly gorgeous, I just want to know how did Ireland go from a poor country to a very developed one and what the early stage of it's development was like?","['The early days were very difficult as there was a civil war immediately after independence, with people who fought together during the war of independence now on opposite sides depending on whether they supported or opposed the treaty with the UK. There were many points of disagreement, the main one was whether or not to accept the partition of the island that was part of the treaty.\n\nAfter the civil war, Ireland was very poor economically. This was partly because the governing party for the next ten years was quite right wing so insisted on running a balanced budget when perhaps they should have borrowed to invest in infrastructure.\n\nDespite the civil war, Ireland was quite stable after independence as most of the structures left behind by the UK (such as a capable and effective civil service) remained in place.  However, there was a potential army mutiny in 1924 that was repressed by the government, and the deputy leader of the government was assassinated in 1927.\n\nMany of the old English aristocracy who immigrated to Ireland under British rule left, but that continued a trend that had been going on since the 1880s when land reform removed their main economic tied to Ireland.\n\nThe government changed in 1932 when the leader of the anti-treaty party from the civil war was elected. The economy struggled even more in the coming years due to a trade war with the UK (our largest trading partner) as Ireland insisted on the return of three ports that the UK had kept after the treaty. The ports were ultimately returned, but the economy suffered badly and emigration of young people to other countries was extremely high.\n\nRepublicans who resisted UK presence in the north thought the new government of the 1930s would support them, as that party had opposed the settlement with Britain in 1922, but instead the Republicans were repressed to avoid further conflict with the UK.\n\nThat government wrote a new constitution in 1937, which effectively removed the remaining links to the UK, such as parliament swearing allegiance to the UK monarch and replaced a UK crown appointed Governor General with an elected President as head of state.\n\nIreland remained neutral during World War II, a policy which was supported across the political spectrum largely as it was seen as the latest war between European great powers and of no consequence to a small nation like Ireland. This was before the holocaust and abuses of the Nazis were common knowledge.\n\nIreland finally declared itself a Republic in 1949 and left the commonwealth.\n\nIreland remained economically poor until we joined the EEC (which became the European Union) when we received substantial structural funds, which facilitated investment in infrastructure, which in turn was one of the factors to facilitate attracting foreign direct investment of foreign companies in Ireland (the other factor being a highly educated English-speaking workforce in Europe).', ""The church swooped into the power vacuum left by the empire and put their boot to our throats before the old footprints even had a chance to fade, especially for women\n\nOne example being that my own grandmother was fatherless and taken out of school to raise 8 younger siblings from the age of 9, and had to keep it all a secret because him dying from tuberculosis was considered some kind of innate sin or judgement of God by the church.\n\nHe died alone, buried in an unmarked grave and they lied to all the neighbours that he went to England for work to keep up appearances.\n\nWhen she grew up she nearly died after having 2 children and was given her last rites by a priest 3 different times, but because contraception was illegal she had 5 more children that kept her in a constant cycle of depression, illness and poverty\n\nOn the other side my other grandmother was born into a laundry which is a horror story unto itself. \nMarried off at 15 to an older man and then stuck in an abusive relationship with too many kids that she wasn't allowed to leave because divorce was illegal, sent back to him by the priest every time she fled. \nSo she drank herself to death\n\nI'm so thankful for how far we've come but we still have quite a ways to go when you look below the surface"", ""it wasn't a republic....""]",0.07766868686868685,0.4188726551226552,1

The head of the UN World Food Programme claimed [40% of the world’s land is **degraded**](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c977r51e1z0o)—a figure that could jump to 95% by mid-century. A growing fraction of the world’s land—and population—is therefore dependent on food imports; [see Morocco](https://apanews.net/177964-2/). And with worsening agricultural harvests, drought, and supply difficulties, feeding these people will not be easy. Roughly [**100M hectares of land are desertified**](https://themedialine.org/life-lines/too-hot-for-peace-desertification-global-warming-fueling-middle-east-unrest/) **or** [**degraded**](https://www.unccd.int/news-stories/press-releases/least-100-million-hectares-healthy-land-now-lost-each-year) every year—equivalent to…well, a lot. Borneo is just under 75M hectares, and [Wikipedia lists it](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_islands_by_area) as the 3rd largest non-continental island. 

A [**6.3 earthquake** struck 25km off Peru](https://phys.org/news/2024-06-earthquake-magnitude-southern-peru.html), in the ocean—causing no damage. Flodding in Assam [affected 105,000+](https://www.business-standard.com/india-news/flood-situation-worsens-in-assam-more-than-100000-people-affected-124061700892_1.html) people. In southern China, [flooding damaged thousands of homes](https://archive.ph/hG2gy), 8,000+ hectares of crops, and killed at least 12 people. The city of Guilin saw [**30+ cm of rain**](https://x.com/yangyubin1998/status/1803471268613894210) **in 6 hours**—its largest flood on record. [Drought, poverty, and land degradation](https://www.arise.tv/nigeria-says-drought-has-severely-impacted-40-million-citizens/) in Nigeria continue. 

At least [2 people died](https://phys.org/news/2024-06-cyprus-death-heatstroke-temperatures-soar.html) from heatstroke in Cyprus, following a Mediterranean heat wave. A [**heat wave**](https://x.com/extremetemps/status/1802402606096015781) struck southern Russia, bringing temperatures as high as 39 °C in some places. A [wildfire in LA](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/california-post-fire-evacuations-b2564129.html) is growing, forcing the evacuation of 1,200+ residents. A [recent study](https://acp.copernicus.org/articles/24/6937/2024/) in *European Geosciences Union* confirms the obvious: large wildfires create hotter & drier temperatures by trapping soot in the air, which contributes to a feedback loop that makes future wildfires in the region more likely. 

Worldwide, this June will [probably be](https://x.com/hausfath/status/1802819464528015613) the **hottest June on record**—perhaps exceeding last year by 0.2 °C. One [scientist indicated](https://x.com/US_Stormwatch/status/1802380988036845733) that June 13, 2024, was the **all-time hottest day on earth** since records began. Observers are forecasting the Paris Olympics to be [the hottest ever Olympic Games](https://www.theguardian.com/sport/article/2024/jun/18/paris-olympics-2024-weather-summer-temperatures-extreme-heat). Yet in Australia, [winter has begun](https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/article/2024/jun/22/coldest-start-to-winter-in-decades-in-some-areas-with-polar-air-mass-predicted-across-australia-next-week) as one of the coldest starts of winter in decades. 

A heat wave [hit Taiwan](https://x.com/extremetemps/status/1801977971420328124), and Japan is [expecting](https://www.timeout.com/tokyo/news/this-summer-could-be-japans-hottest-yet-061724) its hottest summer ever. South Korea [felt its hottest June day](https://asianews.network/south-korea-hit-by-hottest-june-day-on-record/) of all time—37.7 °C (100 °F). A [heat wave also struck Brazil](https://x.com/extremetemps/status/1802498648636260667). A [storm in Chile](https://news.cgtn.com/news/2024-06-18/One-dead-thousands-of-homes-damaged-after-storm-hits-Chile-1uwLEG9jhbq/p.html) forced 11,000 to leave their homes, and also killed one person. A [**landslide** in Ecuador](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/ecuador-ap-pain-quito-amazon-b2564313.html) killed 8+, with 11 still missing.

An interesting [study](https://journals.ametsoc.org/view/journals/bams/105/5/BAMS-D-23-0241.1.xml) in *American Meteorology Society* looked at the Andes Mountains, and [concluded](https://phys.org/news/2024-06-human-edged-sword-drought.html) that **greenhouse gas emissions may actually reduce the likelihood of Drought**—although **increased aerosols increase the chance of Drought**. This tracks with [earlier reports](https://www.ncei.noaa.gov/access/monitoring/monthly-report/global/202313) that say 2023 was a wetter-than-average year, despite many regions experiencing Megadrought.

A [study](https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/sciadv.ado5179) in *Science Advances* looked at the effect on surface air temperatures caused by cloud coverage. Clouds warm the earth at night by trapping radiation, yet cool the earth during the daytime by reflecting sunlight back. Long-term, on a global scale, there tends to be greater cloud coverage at night than during the day, meaning that the cloud coverage “asymmetry, therefore, turns out to be an **amplifier of surface warming**, by both decreasing the daytime cloud shortwave albedo effect and increasing the nighttime cloud longwave greenhouse effect.”

An [interesting website](https://fitzlab.shinyapps.io/cityapp/) from the University of Maryland’s Center for Environmental Science allows you to search any of 40,000+ places on a map and check the **climate forecast for the year 2080**. Their database is based on predictions made by the IPCC, and does not account for all possible climate factors (like an early breakdown of the AMOC). You can also customize your settings to measure for an optimistic reduced emissions future, and also see an average of 5 forecasts. Some scholars [disagree](https://theconversation.com/the-problems-with-climate-scenarios-and-how-to-fix-them-230141) with the methodology used by the IPCC to forecast future climate conditions.

A [study](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0048969724032017) in *Science Direct* examined the economic costs of *Aedes* mosquitoes carrying “**Dengue, Zika** and [**chikungunya**](https://www.cdc.gov/chikungunya/about/index.html),” among other viruses. The scientists believe the economic cost is underestimated—and projected to worsen. The cost of treating the sick is far more than the cost of managing the spread of mosquitoes/virus—but budgeting for prevention requires long-term thinking and acting responsibly, which are not common traits among *homo sapiens*.

The [2024 Statistical **Review of World Energy**](https://www.energyinst.org/statistical-review) report came out a few days ago, and its 76 pages cover energy developments & consumption in the year 2023. It reports a still-rapidly industrializing China, producing & consuming coal, wind, solar, LNG, and oil. China has also exceeded the U.S. in its capacity to refine oil for the first time. The [Global South](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Global_North_and_Global_South), which consumes about 56% of the world’s energy, is seeing its overall demand grow at twice the rate of developed countries. The report also contains some amazing data tables detailing the various energy production for about 60 countries year-by-year from 2013-2023—and regional energy summaries.

>“**Total primary energy consumption increased by 2% over its 2022 level**, 0.6% above its ten-year average and over 5% above its 2019 pre-COVID level….**consumption of crude oil broke through the 100 million barrels per day level for the first time ever and coal demand beat the previous year’s record level**….whilst North America witnessed a modest increase in oil consumption of around 0.8%, demand in Europe fell by nearly 1% to 13.9 million barrels per day. By contrast, the Asia Pacific region saw an increase of over 5% to 38 million barrels per day….Global {liquified natural} gas production remained relatively constant compared to 2022…. The US remains the largest producer of gas delivering around a quarter of the world’s supply….Global coal production reached its highest ever level (179 exajoules), beating the previous high set the year before. The Asia Pacific region accounted for nearly 80% of global output with activity concentrated in just four countries, Australia, China, India, and Indonesia….**coal retained its position as the dominant fuel for power generation in 2023 with a stable share around 35%**....Wind achieved a record year for new build with over 115 GW coming online. Nearly 66% of capacity additions were in China and its total installed capacity is now equal to North America and Europe combined. Solar accounted for 75% (346 GW) of the capacity additions with China responsible for around a quarter of the growth.” -excerpts from the key highlights

After coming across [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/Morocco/comments/1gr4d1n/morocco_will_never_improve_due_to_moroccans/) ~~yesterday~~ some time ago, and seeing u/lee_hwaq's comment:

>your daily morocco suck post i would love to see solutions

I decided to make a post about a book I'm outlining on what I, a layman, think are Morocco's various and quite numerous woes, and how I think they can be approached.

So as to not be shady, in the book, in each chapter, I will first provide an analysis with what I perceive to be problems and, more importantly, why I think so, and what I would consider to be an ideal state of affairs. Then I will state a strategy, solution or approach to the issue that seems feasible to me, to get from where we are to where I'd like us to be, or as close as realistically possible in the given context. I do this because for example, an Islamist and a Feminist might agree that the state of women in Morocco is horrendous, but for opposite reasons, so it helps to say *in* *what way* one considerns something to be a problem, and *why*.

Below are the chapters of the book, along with some chaotic notes for myself (order and chapters may be revised). Please let me know if there's something that you think I should look at, or any thoughts that you may have.

1. **Education and Literacy**
   1. The Language Question(s):
      * Darija vs Arabic: The language continuum and dialectal differentiation, diglossia and linguistic borrowing from Amazigh, French and Spanish. The impact of being condemned to learning in an essentially foreign language. Assessing the feasability and desirability of attempting to standardize Darija vis-à-vis the Arabic-speaking world, Islam, and the Maghreb
      * Arabic vs Amazigh: How is our bi-national identity faring in the face of centralization and homogenization? and what is the impact of the elevation of Amazigh to official status? Exploring various cases: Spain's autonomous regions, France through the ages (From Picardy to Corsica, from Guyana to Tahiti), Turkish Kurdistan, Iranian Azerbaijan, Guangzhou (Canton). Switzerland, Belgium, Friesland, Ireland, Taiwan, maybe India?

For me this will be a learning journey as much as it will be an opportunity to express myself on various topics, so I'm very interested in hearing what you think about the various subjects that I'm planning on exploring with my limited knowledge and understanding as a non-expert. This isn't really to prescribe solutions, though I will do that (and I expect and welcome criticism and counter-suggestions), but it's more to bounce ideas off people and get a critique of my thoughts.

A [study](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41561-024-01466-6) in *Nature Geoscience* claims that **slush contains most of the meltwater on the ice shelves** in the Antarctic. The results [indicate](https://phys.org/news/2024-06-antarctic-ice-shelves-meltwater-previously.html) “slush and pooled meltwater leads to 2.8 times more meltwater formation than predicted by standard climate models.” The study authors conclude that many previous studies have dramatically undercounted the quantity of meltwater because many studies only look at pooled water and ignore slush.

Temperatures in Iraq [hit 50 °C](https://www.newarab.com/news/scorching-heat-long-power-outages-prompt-iraqis-protest) (122 °F), and **knocked out the electrical grid**. Anti-government demonstrations followed. Some cities in Iraq regularly go 10 hours each day without electricity. Kuwait [also faced **power outages**](https://tribune.com.pk/story/2473068/kuwait-announces-power-outages-as-demand-surges-amid-summer-heat) caused by the [record-hot temperatures](https://x.com/extremetemps/status/1804844715965104588). An adjusted death toll for people making the Hajj pilgrimage [counts **1,300+ heat deaths**](https://www.theguardian.com/world/article/2024/jun/23/hajj-pilgrimage-death-toll-extreme-heat-mecca-saudi-arabia) now. 

Drought around the Black Sea is [causing harvest problems](https://archive.ph/XcDZf), particularly for grain. Last May was the **driest May in Ukraine in 30+ years**. Türkiye is [experiencing many more wildfires](https://bianet.org/haber/turkey-faces-fivefold-increase-in-wildfires-in-june-compared-to-last-year-296756) now than at the same time last year. Mardin, Türkiye, saw [a **record hot night**](https://x.com/extremetemps/status/1804936824886014120), at 30.9 °C (87 °F). A number of [locations in Greece](https://x.com/extremetemps/status/1804581870941724920) also saw record hot June days & nights. Southeastern Spain [is bracing](https://spanishnewstoday.com/prepare_for_brutal_summer_after_second_hottest_spring_in_64_years_warns_murcia_government_1000083302-a.html) for a hot summer, after a nearly record-breaking **hot & dry spring**. Hong Kong is [poised](https://www.timeout.com/hong-kong/news/heat-wave-in-hong-kong-might-break-record-length-062824) to set its **all-time longest heat wave**. Across the world, the [dangers to outdoor workers](https://edition.cnn.com/2024/06/21/economy/outdoor-workers-extreme-heat-temperature/index.html) are growing. Over 60% of the world’s population [lived under extreme temperatures](https://www.independent.co.uk/climate-change/news/heatwave-june-temperatures-climate-change-b2570608.html) in June 2024.

[8 died](https://www.voanews.com/a/landslide-kills-8-in-china-s-central-hunan-province-after-heavy-rainfall/7667187.html) in a **landslide** in central China. [Record temperatures](https://x.com/extremetemps/status/1805069332826988962) for June struck across a number of Japan locations. At least [5 died](https://www.rferl.org/a/mudslides-floods-kill-five-kyrgyzstan-rain/33013516.html) in Kyrgyzstan mudslides & flooding. A [7.2 earthquake](https://phys.org/news/2024-06-magnitude-earthquake-southern-peru.html) hit southern Peru on Friday, but there were no reports of human casualties. A **long heat wave in Pakistan** [killed 560+](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cn05rz3w4x1o) and counting. 

The world’s [**worst coral bleaching event**](https://edition.cnn.com/2024/06/27/climate/coral-bleaching-hurricanes/index.html) has some scientists wishing hurricanes, which act as large-scale “heat vacuums,” would happen more frequently, in order to bring up colder water that might cool the coral habitats. However, storms that are too strong can also tear up coral ecosystems, and cause damage to humans. The EU is [forecasting 4-7 major storms](https://reliefweb.int/map/mexico/2024-hurricane-season-forecast-dg-echo-daily-map-26062024) in the Atlantic this hurricane season.

The EU Parliament is [**deprioritizing climate change**](https://www.politico.eu/article/eu-leaders-ditch-call-prepare-new-realities-warmer-planet-green-deal-climate-crisis/) legislation for the coming 5-year term. The 8-page [strategic agenda](https://www.consilium.europa.eu/media/4aldqfl2/2024_557_new-strategic-agenda.pdf) released on Thursday instead focuses on “upholding European values,” improving regional security, managing the flow of migration, and improving economic competitiveness—although it does still mention the green transition and water resilience.

A [paywalled study](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41558-024-02034-x)’s abstract claims that the **intertropical convergence zone** (ITCZ)—a band of low-pressure latitudes near the equator—is expected to be pushed northward for 10-20 years, as a result of CO2 emissions and warming sea surface temperatures. Theoretically, this shift [will bring tropical rainfall patterns](https://phys.org/news/2024-06-climate-shift-tropical-northward.html) several degrees northward, before shifting south for a long time. One climate professor claimed, “the northward shift will last for only about 20 years before greater forces stemming from warming southern oceans pull the convergence zones back southward and keep them there for another millennium.” 

Drought in North Carolina, affecting 99% of the state, has caused a “[**total loss**](https://www.agriculture.com/much-of-north-carolina-s-corn-crop-a-total-loss-as-drought-conditions-increase-statewide-8671497)” **of its corn crop** this year. An [uncontained wildfire](https://edition.cnn.com/2024/06/28/us/arizona-boulder-view-fire-maricopa-county/index.html) in Maricopa County, Arizona, forced the evacuation of dozens of homes. In the Netherlands, they experienced (by far) their [**wettest 8 months**](https://x.com/LeonSimons8/status/1806721097959723388) in history. 

**Record heat** in [parts of Indonesia](https://x.com/extremetemps/status/1806598420020281640), and [parts of Saudi Arabia](https://x.com/extremetemps/status/1806306790029623638), in [Algeria](https://x.com/extremetemps/status/1806396235827359914), and parts [of Germany](https://x.com/extremetemps/status/1806271081298161990). For the first time in 469 days, sea surface temperatures [did *not* break a record](https://x.com/EliotJacobson/status/1806344202701398259). 

**Wildfires** in [Russia’s Arctic Circle](https://www.euronews.com/green/2024/06/28/arctic-wildfires-tear-through-russias-far-north-releasing-megatonnes-of-carbon) woodlands. Scientists report that Canada’s wildfires in 2023 [put more CO2 into the air](https://www.theguardian.com/world/article/2024/jun/27/canada-2023-wildfires-carbon-emissions) than all of India’s fossil fuel burning. Canada’s wildfires were responsible for 27% of the world’s loss in tree cover last year. A [paywalled study](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41559-024-02452-2)’s abstract claims that **wildfires have more than doubled in the last 21 years**, and that 6 of our 7 most extreme wildfire years have occurred in the last 7 years.

A [20-page article](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/science/articles/10.3389/fsci.2024.1349350/full) published last week identified almost 17,000 sites that should be conserved in order to protect the world’s most sensitive biodiverse ecosystems. 5 countries made up over 50% of the sites: the Philippines, Brazil, Indonesia, Madagascar and Colombia.

A [study](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41561-024-01465-7) in *Nature Geoscience* looked at the ways water eats away at an ice sheet’s grounding line, the place at which many large ice sheets sit on earth. The researchers believe that **the impact of warm and cool water weakening the integrity of ice shelves is underappreciated** in forecasting future ice sheet retreat, and may indicate another tipping point for the stability of giant ice shelves.

**Antimicrobial resistance** (AMR) is [expected](https://archive.ph/yacyiO) to cause 10M+ deaths each year by 2050. Some believe the issue is “more acute than climate change,” though the two are interrelated. Some superbugs [can live in the body for many years](https://www.darkdaily.com/2024/06/28/researchers-find-that-antibiotic-resistant-bacteria-can-persist-in-the-body-for-years/) and later infect others.

Finland is [offering a bird flu vaccine](https://archive.ph/wGifO) to people who work with animals—starting next week. Most experts [don’t think](https://nationalpost.com/news/what-to-know-about-bird-flu-h5n1) a major vaccination effort is necessary, though they also say that [government responses have been lacking](https://www.statnews.com/2024/06/26/bird-flu-outbreak-avian-flu-containment-h5n1-eradication-in-cattle/) so far. “**It’s not [being] managed as a zoonotic disease that is a potential dynamic threat**,” said one researcher. Bird flu traces have [been found in San Francisco’s wastewater](https://archive.ph/VSjBB), and authorities aren’t sure how it got there, since there are practically no farms there. 

LA’s mayor, who herself [currently has COVID](https://www.dailynews.com/2024/06/28/la-mayor-karen-bass-test-positive-for-covid-19/), is [considering a mask ban](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/article/2024/jun/25/los-angeles-mask-ban-covid) at protests, following a controversial protest outside an LA synagogue. [Horror stories](https://www.theguardian.com/society/article/2024/jun/19/a-30-second-walk-would-exhaust-me-natacha-life-with-long-covid) continue to emerge about people who have had their once active lives upended by a debilitating case of Long COVID. The new “consensus” [definition of **Long COVID**](https://www.health.com/long-covid-universal-definition-8663597) requires 3 things of a possible Long COVID case: 1) it is associated with a COVID infection, 2) it remains for at least three months (either continuously or intermittently), and 3) it affects one or more organ systems.

A 24-page [report](https://www.healthdata.org/research-analysis/library/global-burden-disease-2021-findings-gbd-2021-study), published last month, on the Global Burden of Disease in the year 2021, claimed that **COVID reduced worldwide life expectancies by 1.6 years**—though they predict overall life expectancy will rise by 4.6 years from 2022 to 2050. The report is also focused on birth rates and overall health risk factors.

The most **dangerous strain of mpox** [is circulating in the DRC](https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/article/2024/jun/26/democratic-republic-congo-drc-virulent-strain-mpox-monkeypox-virus-killing-children-miscarriages), close to the border of Rwanda and Burundi. The province is one of the Congo’s most restive and violent regions, where treatments and vaccines for the contagious illness are unavailable. This particular variant, Clade I, has a CFR of 5-10%. 

India’s water shortage worsens—yet some [outlets](https://www.channelnewsasia.com/business/worsening-water-crisis-can-weigh-indias-sovereign-credit-strength-moodys-says-4434421) seem to be primarily concerned with its impact on the country’s creditworthiness. Bengaluru, however, is [expected](https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/bengaluru-news/bengaluru-might-shatter-weather-records-by-seeing-its-wettest-june-in-history-report-101719200077308.html) to finish its wettest June on record. 

Global **lithium consumption is expected to increase 40x by 2040**. Argentina has found itself [scaling up lithium mining](https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/article/2024/jun/25/battle-lines-redrawn-as-argentinas-lithium-mines-ramp-up-to-meet-electric-car-demand) drastically, draining their water in the process. Locals are being pressured to cede their ancestral lands, and mining corporations are dividing communities to impose their will. One tonne of lithium requires about 2M liters of water to extract, as well as adding contaminants to the nearby ecosystem. 

An [article](https://energyskeptic.com/2024/peak-potassium-threatens-crops/) published in a Collapse blog last week reports that **at least 20% of global soils are experiencing a potassium deficiency**, as a result of “intensive agricultural practices.” Potash, a potassium compound used in fertilizer, is [mostly produced](https://investingnews.com/daily/resource-investing/agriculture-investing/potash-investing/top-potash-countries-by-production/) in only 3 countries (Canada, China, and Russia, in declining order), though Belarus, Germany, and Israel also produce decent quantities. The author hypothesizes that supply shortages will prevent the necessary doubling of global food production to meet the expected demand in 2050, resulting in a **massive energy shortage**. 

Nvidia’s market cap [has surpassed the entire stock market](https://x.com/KobeissiLetter/status/1804141149877158116) in France or the UK. **Water demand from AI** [may equal](https://www.business2community.com/business-news/the-hidden-costs-of-ai-electricity-and-water-usage-skyrockets-threatening-the-planet-02812384) half the UK’s annual water consumption by 2027. [Some believe](https://archive.ph/jwlUn) that the increased electrical demand from AI—data centers are expected to consume another 2-6% of global electricity—is worth the additional productivity. AI has also [recently been used](https://phys.org/news/2024-06-el-nio-months-physics-based.html) to forecast the [El Niño Southern Oscillation](https://www.climate.gov/news-features/blogs/enso/what-el-ni%C3%B1o%E2%80%93southern-oscillation-enso-nutshell) (ENSO) 18 months in advance, according to [a study](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-024-07534-6) in *Nature.* 

China is [backing off from its net-zero pledge](https://archive.fo/dV3CY) as the reality of energy production & demand set in. Simply put, **coal is the “backbone of the energy system and a source of security”** in the country, and the leaders prefer to prioritize the growth of the economy. China is reportedly particularly concerned about unrest caused by blackouts caused by insufficient electricity. To meet the demand forecasted, they are constructing new coal plants—in 2023, coal plants capable of producing 47.4 gigawatts of power were built.

The U.S. Energy Information Administration released a 59-page [forecast](https://www.eia.gov/outlooks/steo/pdf/steo_full.pdf) of energy in the next 12 months. They expect crude oil & petrol prices to generally hold steady, though LNG is expected to rise in price. The full report contains over 50 graphs and several large data tables. [An energy blogger](https://peakoilbarrel.com/short-term-energy-outlook-june-2024) made a summary of the report.

[**Illegal water markets**](https://smartwatermagazine.com/blogs/christian-klassert/climate-crisis-sees-rise-illegal-water-markets-middle-east) are becoming more common across the Middle East as Droughts intensify and governments fail to secure the necessities of life. Are we witnessing the **transition away from governments towards a more mercantile/mercenary future**?

At least 22 people in Nairobi [were killed](https://www.theguardian.com/world/article/2024/jun/25/kenyan-police-shoot-dead-protesters-as-crowd-try-to-storm-parliament) by security forces when a large crowd of anti-government protestors attempted to storm the Kenyan Parliament on Tuesday. “We don’t have work so we can be here every day. **If we can’t find something to live for, we will find something to die for**,” one protestor said. The President called the protests “treasonous” but [later acceded](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c3gg30gm0x2o) to some of their demands. Kenya also [sent over 400 police](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cy7772v3j89o) to help restore stability to Haiti—another 2,100 (600 from Kenya, and 1,500 from other countries) are set to arrive in the coming months. 

Bolivia [survived an **attempted coup**](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/6/27/bolivia-foils-military-coup-attempt-all-you-need-to-know) on Wednesday, led by an Army general who brought tanks and soldiers to the Presidential Palace, motivated primarily by economic grievances. A few hours later, the soldiers obeyed the orders of the President, reversing the general’s momentum and leading to his arrest. Rumors are growing that it may have [been a controlled coup attempt](https://www.theguardian.com/world/article/2024/jun/29/bolivias-president-accused-of-plotting-coup-against-himself-to-boost-popularity) designed to boost support for the President.

A weak presidential debate performance has [panicked many American Democrats](https://archive.ph/Zxzai), and left observers bracing for the near realization of a second Trump presidency. The Supreme Court of the United States [issued a ruling](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/supreme-court-chevron-deference-power-of-federal-agencies/) **limiting the regulatory power of federal agencies**. They [also ruled](https://apnews.com/article/supreme-court-homeless-camping-bans-506ac68dc069e3bf456c10fcedfa6bee) that states may restrict the public areas in which homeless people may sleep, and decided that such bans do not count as cruel and/or unusual punishment.

Poland is [considering totally closing its border](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cldddvpgk90o) with Belarus because of (Bela)Russian hybrid migrant warfare. [Military drills](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/6/22/us-aircraft-carrier-arrives-in-south-korea-amid-tensions-with-north-korea) between the U.S., South Korea, and Japan were conducted, following security agreements in the region and recent North Korean provocations. The Philippines [has installed](https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/philippines-envoy-hails-brahmos-missiles-as-a-game-changer/article68328182.ece) a **“game-changer” anti-ship missile defense system** in Luzon, facing the South China Sea. Other [developments concerning the Second Thomas Shoal](https://archive.ph/IUfS8) threaten to spark a China-Philippines conflict as well. Ursula von der Leyen appears to have [secured another 5-year term](https://www.theguardian.com/world/article/2024/jun/27/ursula-von-der-leyen-wins-second-term-as-european-commission-president) as President of the European Commission—the executive arm of the EU.

Thousands of Iranian fighters have reportedly [volunteered](https://archive.ph/diuLr) to fight with Hezbollah against Israel, if a full-scale War takes shape. Some think that War would [spiral into WWIII](https://www.dailysabah.com/opinion/columns/world-war-iii-knocking-on-the-door) sooner than expected, and [a growing number of countries have warned](https://www.aa.com.tr/en/middle-east/7-countries-urge-citizens-to-leave-lebanon-amid-fears-of-war-with-israel/3261855) their citizens to leave Lebanon as soon as possible (the U.S., the UK, Kuwait, Jordan, Russia, Ireland, Canada, Germany, North Macedonia, Saudi Arabia, and the Netherlands). There have already [been 7,400+ cross-border attacks](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/6/27/mapping-7400-cross-border-attacks-between-israel-and-lebanon) between Israel and Hezbollah in Lebanon, though Israel has launched about 4x as many strikes. Israel’s Supreme Court [unanimously decided](https://www.theguardian.com/world/article/2024/jun/25/israeli-court-rules-ultra-orthodox-men-can-be-drafted-for-military-service) that there are no exemptions from military conscription for ultra-orthodox men. Save The Children [estimates](https://www.wbur.org/hereandnow/2024/06/27/gaza-missing-children) that **21,000 children have gone missing in Gaza**. A [brief WFP report](https://www.ipcinfo.org/fileadmin/user_upload/ipcinfo/docs/IPC_Gaza_Strip_Acute_Food_Insecurity_MaySept2024_Special_Snapshot.pdf) on food insecurity in Gaza claims that 95% of Gaza is facing at least Phase 3 Famine (Phase 5 is the worst), and it’s only getting worse.

A May fire at an arms factory in Berlin, originally thought to be an accident, is now blamed on [Russian saboteurs](https://archive.ph/ekBLo). More [ICC warrants were issued](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c988qjje02eo) for the Ukraine War, now targeting two high military officials, Shoigu & Gerasimov. Rumors emerged, and were [later debunked](https://www.nknews.org/2024/06/fact-check-north-korea-has-not-announced-plans-to-send-troops-to-ukraine-yet/), claiming that North Korea would send 75% of its military engineers to occupied Ukraine to build fortifications for Russia. Terrorist shooters [killed 15 Russians](https://apnews.com/article/dagestan-militant-attack-churches-synagogue-police-d4ceba71308ab75b28e128991776b2b5) in Dagestan. 

Ukraine’s use of **sea drones** [has brought great success](https://archive.ph/TS74s) in its quest to cripple Russia’s Black Sea Fleet. Ukraine is reportedly planning to create small squads of 10-20 agile drones which, combined, can bring to bear firepower comparable to a proper warship. A [Russian strike](https://archive.ph/N6JVu) on a Dnipro apartment building killed 1 and injured 12. One Ukrainian soldier relocated to Kharkiv [claims](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cjerdw9g159o) the banks of the Dnipro River resemble a “**moonscape**” because there are so many craters. [Escalation continues](https://apnews.com/article/russia-ukraine-war-putin-offensive-a0c813d0c5c3c05943d4bec9306dbcd6) on both sides. 

Observers and humanitarian agencies are continuing to say that [**starvation as a weapon of warfare**](https://www.theguardian.com/world/article/2024/jun/26/sudan-war-starvation-famine-human-rights-experts-un) has been employed in Sudan—and 2.5M people will die of starvation by the end of September, according to one think tank. Over 750,000 are [currently facing Phase 5 Famine](https://www.unicef.org/press-releases/sudan-facing-unprecedented-hunger-catastrophe-say-un-agency-chiefs), defined as: “the absolute inaccessibility of food to an entire population or sub-group of a population, potentially causing death in the short term.”

**Last Week in Collapse: October 22-28, 2023**

This is *Last Week in Collapse*, a weekly newsletter bringing together some of the most important, timely, useful, depressing, ironic, astonishing, or otherwise must-see moments in Collapse. 

This is the 96th newsletter, and at 3,300+ words, the longest one yet. You can find the October 15-21 edition [here](https://old.reddit.com/r/collapse/comments/17dnfb5/last_week_in_collapse_october_1521_2023/) if you missed it last week. 

It has come to my attention that there is someone else in the Collapse community who has basically been plagiarizing this newsletter, rewording a few sentences, and passing off this content as his own monthly newsletter on another platform, for money. It is obviously a lazy rebrand of *Last Week in Collapse*. I am choosing to leave this writer anonymous at this point. I have no problem with people sharing this newsletter—and I encourage all dissemination of Collapse news—but please don’t plagiarize my efforts here. You can just link to my Reddit post and give your readers free access, instead of paywalling my work for your profit. Notwithstanding another writer who had permission to temporarily syndicate LWIC, this newsletter is only posted in two places: r/Collapse, and on [my Substack](https://substack.com/profile/18092228-last-week-in-collapse), for those who want an email version sent to their inbox every Sunday. Enough said on this point, for now.

As **Israel prepares its ground invasion of Gaza**, fears grow that [**Hezbollah could bring Lebanon**](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-67201107) **and Iran into this growing War**. The [results would be terrible](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/oct/25/iran-hezbollah-lebanese-war-middle-east) for everyone. The [United States would certainly join](https://english.alarabiya.net/News/middle-east/2023/10/24/US-preparing-for-significant-escalation-against-US-forces-in-near-term) a conflict if it includes Iran. Iran produces about ⅛ of the Middle East’s total oil extraction (25% of Saudi’s production), which [funds 70% of the government](https://time.com/6327378/israel-iran-oil-sanctions/). Yet Israel is [interfering with GPS](https://www.politico.com/news/2023/10/23/israels-gps-tampering-deter-hezbollahs-missiles-00123026) signals near Lebanon already, preparatory measures for an **expected attack**. Hezbollah militants [may not be able to restrain themselves](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/world-news/2023/10/24/hezbollah-split-elite-commando-pushes-chiefs-to-join-war/). 

Israeli [**bombings continued**](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/oct/23/gaza-second-aid-convoy-rafah-crossing-israel-bombardment) **in Gaza** all week long. Some [strikes were made](https://english.almayadeen.net/news/politics/israeli-airstrike-targets-aleppo-airport-puts-it-out-of-serv) in Syria by Israel, and [by the U.S.](https://archive.ph/y13nc). The current death toll for Palestinians [is over 7,000](https://news.un.org/en/story/2023/10/1142687) with **no end in sight**. The EU is [calling for a stop](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/oct/26/eu-expected-to-back-call-for-humanitarian-pauses-of-gaza-shelling) to the fighting so more aid can come into Gaza, which has also [been starved of electricity](https://archive.ph/eWoxD). But for Israel, their ground incursion [is just beginning](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/oct/26/joe-biden-west-bank-settlers-israel-prepares-gaza-ground-invasion). Within 3 weeks, **this War left more dead than 6 months of War in Sudan**. The UN [is passing resolutions](https://news.un.org/en/story/2023/10/1142847?reload12) but these are not doing much to stop the fighting. 

The War in Sudan [has displaced 5.6M people](https://abcnews.go.com/International/sudan-now-worst-humanitarian-nightmares-recent-history/story?id=104173197) so far, one of the widest humanitarian disasters of 2023. However, both sides [are meeting in Jeddah](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/10/26/sudan-warring-sides-resume-peace-talks-in-saudi-arabia) to arrange an agreeable settlement of the War. Some analysts think [**it’s all about money**](https://africanarguments.org/2023/10/the-sinews-of-sudans-latest-war/). 

Almost two months after a pair of earthquakes struck Morocco, thousands of survivors [are still not getting any aid](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-africa-67213441). In a real Collapse, nobody is coming to save you. Poverty across Africa [is **forcing girls to drop out**](https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2023/oct/25/girls-in-africa-quitting-school-over-cost-of-living-crisis-says-charity) **of school** to work and become mothers. 

A think tank released [a 125-page report](https://giwps.georgetown.edu/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/WPS-Index-full-report.pdf), the “Women, Peace and Security Index” for 2023. Denmark placed #1, Afghanistan last. 

Russia [struck a post office](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/oct/21/russian-missile-strike-on-kharkiv-postal-centre-has-caused-multiple-deaths-says-governor) in Kharkiv, killing 6 and injuring 16 more. Russian losses during last week’s Avdiivka offensive [have been massive](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/oct/28/russian-losses-in-battle-for-avdiivka-may-be-worst-of-2023-says-uk), with **thousands of soldiers reportedly dead in one week**, all to hold the ruins of a Donetsk city (pre-War pop: 30,000). U.S. intelligence says [**Russians are shooting their own troops**](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-67234144) if they fall back. War.

The UN High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) released [a mid-year report](https://reliefweb.int/report/world/unhcr-forced-displacement-continues-grow-conflicts-escalate) indicating there were **about 114M forcibly displaced people worldwide** at the end of September, about half of whom were internally displaced, half refugees. Better add another 2M from Gaza to the count.

China [replaced its defence minister and its foreign minister](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/oct/24/china-removes-two-key-figures-from-office-in-major-leadership-reshuffle-li-shangfu-qin-gang) last week. Mental illness is being blamed for [a vicious **mass shooting in Maine**](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-67232966) that killed 18 and wounded many others.

[Fighting flared up](https://www.africanews.com/2023/10/23/eastern-drc-fighting-again-shifts-the-balance-in-north-kivu/) for the first time in months in eastern DRC, where **M23 militants** seized the town Kitshanga, and are fighting in another nearby area. [An **ISIS affiliate** active](https://www.france24.com/en/live-news/20231024-civilian-massacre-in-dr-congo-as-clashes-spread) in the region also reportedly massacred 26 in the eastern DRC. The Congolese President is [canceling the UN mission](https://vigourtimes.com/why-dr-congo-urgently-calls-for-withdrawal-of-east-african-troops-a-complex-situation-unveiled/) because they were ineffective, and [ordered them out](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-africa-67239214) by year’s end. M23 fighters also [killed a Kenyan soldier](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-africa-67213501), the first Kenyan slain in the force this year. A different UN mission is [also leaving Mali](https://www.africanews.com/2023/10/23/un-peacekeepers-expedite-pullout-from-norther-mali-camp-amid-tense-security-context/) amid **worsening political & security problems**. 

**Drug and corruption-related** [**shootings** across Mexico](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/10/24/wave-of-mexico-attacks-kills-22-including-a-dozen-police-in-one-day) killed 22+ people in one day, about half of whom were police. In one attack, in Guerrero state, a government convoy was ambushed, [killing 11 police and a security official](https://www.france24.com/en/americas/20231024-armed-attacks-in-mexico-leave-16-dead-including-12-police-officers). 

Italy’s PM is [struggling to keep her promise](https://archive.ph/UZkQQ) to manage migration influxes. Meanwhile, one of the Spanish Canary Islands “[is becoming Lampedusa](https://www.africanews.com/2023/10/26/becoming-lampedusa-migrant-arrivals-surge-on-remote-spanish-island/)” due to **large numbers of arriving migrants**. Pakistan is [giving its last warning](https://archive.ph/6EcCX) to illegal immigrants within its borders, mostly several hundred thousand Afghans. Deportations are set to begin on November 1.

Tensions [continue growing](https://www.crisisgroup.org/asia/north-east-asia/taiwan-strait-china/333-preventing-war-taiwan-strait) between Taiwan and China. The [strategic ambiguity](https://archive.ph/nunMJ) of the situation has left all actors [operating in uncertainty](https://www.stimson.org/2023/is-a-chinese-invasion-of-taiwan-the-most-likely-scenario/) over Taiwan’s future. 

The United States [is working on a **new atomic Bomb**](https://fas.org/publication/biden-administration-to-build-a-new-nuclear-bomb/), and it’s not exactly clear why. Russia [simulated a nuclear strike](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/oct/25/russia-simulates-nuclear-strike-after-opting-out-of-treaty) last week in a preparedness drill. The Kremlin is less alarmed than the West that [**China is building up its nuclear capabilities**](https://archive.ph/efp43) with the launching of a nuclear-capable submarine and the construction of hundreds more warheads by 2030.

——————————

The IEA (International Energy Agency) has released [a 355-page report](https://iea.blob.core.windows.net/assets/26ca51d0-4a42-4649-a7c0-552d75ddf9b2/WorldEnergyOutlook2023.pdf) about the World Energy outlook for 2023. The [prognosis](https://www.iea.org/reports/world-energy-outlook-2023) is mixed: expecting fossil fuels to peak before 2030, celebrating the growth of China’s renewable energy sector, yet the global surface temperature continues to climb. The full report has 100+ great graphs. 

>”Fossil fuel prices are down from their 2022 peaks, but markets are tense and volatile…the global average surface temperature is already around 1.2 °C above pre-industrial levels, prompting **heatwaves and other extreme weather** events, and greenhouse gas emissions have not yet peaked. **The energy sector is also the primary cause of the polluted air** that more than 90% of the world’s population is forced to breathe, **linked to more than 6 million premature deaths a year**…” -selections from the executive summary

In order for the EU to meet its emissions targets, it will have to [cut its pollution rate by more than 3x](https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2023/oct/24/eu-must-cut-emissions-three-times-more-quickly-report-says?CMP=Share_AndroidApp_Other), according to a [32-page report](https://energy.ec.europa.eu/system/files/2023-10/COM_2023_650_1_EN_ACT_part1_v10.pdf) released on Tuesday. It’s almost time to move the benchmarks and start again.

Another [report out of Brussels](https://caneurope.org/content/uploads/2023/10/NECPs_Assessment-Report_October2023.pdf), this one 98-pages long, paints a dim picture of sustainability. Five EU countries are planning not to meet the binding targets agreed upon. The report includes country-specific assessments if you want to explore specific states’ progress—or lack thereof.

Climate scientists [discovered undersea currents](https://phys.org/news/2023-10-underwater-robot-circulation-pattern-antarctic.html) below the Antarctic ice shelf that better explain overturning circulation patterns around crevasses. The [full study](https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/sciadv.adi7638) explains it better than I can. [Another study](https://phys.org/news/2023-10-meltwater-beneath-antarctic-glaciers-retreat.html) claims that **Antarctic meltwater is flowing out from beneath the ice sheets faster than expected, contributing to ice loss feedback loops**. Another [study](https://www.nature.com/articles/s43247-023-01003-0) indicated that **Arctic cyclones are becoming stronger and longer-lasting**. Yet [another study](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41558-023-01818-x) concludes that [rapid **Antarctic ice melting is inevitable**](https://edition.cnn.com/2023/10/23/world/west-antarctic-ice-melt-climate/index.html), and its impacts on sea level will not go unnoticed. Arctic permafrost [may **unleash toxins**](https://www.counterpunch.org/2023/10/27/20000-toxic-sites-in-sagging-arctic-permafrost/) when it melts.

The annual report “State of the Climate 2023” [came out last week](https://academic.oup.com/bioscience/advance-article/doi/10.1093/biosci/biad080/7319571), and this one is only 10 pages. Climate scientists are freaking out over the **feedback loops, the crossed thresholds, the tipped points**. June-August was the hottest period in recorded human history, and by mid-September earth experienced 38 days with an average temperature above 1.5 °C. And I don’t even want to talk about [**45M acres burned**](https://archive.ph/MmlWE) in Canada this year—so far. That’s an area larger than the size of Sulawesi, Indonesia’s fourth-largest island, or more than twice the size of the Ireland island. 

>”Life on planet Earth is under siege. We are now in an uncharted territory. For several decades, scientists have consistently warned of a future marked by extreme climatic conditions because of escalating global temperatures caused by ongoing human activities that release harmful greenhouse gasses into the atmosphere. Unfortunately, **time is up**. We are seeing the manifestation of those predictions as an alarming and unprecedented succession of climate records are broken, causing profoundly distressing scenes of suffering to unfold. We are entering an unfamiliar domain regarding our climate crisis, a situation no one has ever witnessed firsthand in the history of humanity.”

The Oil company Chevron is [buying Hess Oil](https://www.theguardian.com/business/2023/oct/23/chevron-to-buy-oil-and-gas-producer-hess-corp-in-53bn-all-stock-deal-guyana-shale) for $53B USD, in a stock deal that positions Chevron as one of the world’s top energy firms. Just a couple weeks ago, [Exxon bought another oil company](https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2023/oct/11/exxon-buys-pioneer-natural-resources-fossil-fuels) for almost $60B USD. 

**Hurricane Otis** [struck Mexico](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-latin-america-67213103), bringing 165 mph (270km/ph) winds. It intensified to 80 mph winds (128kph) within 12 hours and grew to a Category 5 storm in less than 24 hours, making it **the fastest-growing storm ever**. The storm [killed at least 27 people](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/10/27/at-least-27-dead-after-hurricane-otis-hits-mexicos-acapulco) and [devastated the infrastructure](https://archive.ph/qE1yn) of Acapulco (pop: 1M). 

In Bangladesh, **Cyclone Hamoon** [killed 3](https://www.independent.co.uk/climate-change/news/bangladesh-cyclone-hamoon-coxs-bazaar-b2435652.html) and sent hundreds of thousands to shelters. Category 5 **Cyclone** [**Lola** slammed Vanuatu](https://www.ifrc.org/press-release/cyclone-lola-leaves-trail-destruction-northern-vanuatu-warning-cyclone-season). Scientists are [exploring other factors](https://journals.ametsoc.org/view/journals/mwre/151/10/MWR-D-23-0038.1.xml), such as thunderstorms, for why storms can intensify so quickly. 

Iran claims that [no water is coming from Afghanistan](https://ifpnews.com/iran-no-water-supply-afghan-side-hirmand-river/)’s side of the Helmand River, and it’s been like this for a month. The **Taliban are reportedly blocking river water from flowing down to Iran amid a fierce drought**. Iran is also [facing drought and wildfires](https://iranwire.com/en/features/121876-iranian-wetlands-endangered-long-before-the-wildfiresfrom-neglect-and-greed/) on its border with Iraq.

Drought is also [being felt in inner Brazil](https://g1.globo.com/am/amazonas/noticia/2023/10/16/seca-severa-no-amazonas-ja-afeta-mais-de-meio-milhao-de-pessoas-aponta-defesa-civil.ghtml), where river levels have dropped concerningly, [revealing old rock carvings](https://archive.ph/kCRI5). The Rio Grande, shared by Mexico and the United States, is [projected](https://theconversation.com/the-rio-grande-isnt-just-a-border-its-a-river-in-crisis-213302) to remain at **crisis levels for the near future**. Saguaro cacti [are dying from heat](https://yaleclimateconnections.org/2023/10/the-slow-death-of-a-desert-giant/) in the Sonora Desert.

India is preparing for [its **largest geoengineering experiment**](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-023-03193-1) ever: building a vast, **15,000+ km network of canals and reservoirs**, in order to move water from wet areas to drier agricultural regions. By redirecting large amounts of water, moisture levels will change, with downstream impacts on temperature, evapotranspiration, cloud formation, and rainfall. 

Climate change [impacts](https://phys.org/news/2023-10-climate-impacts-wildlife-vary-sex.html) wildlife differently depending on what sex they are. In some species, the temperature determines what sex a baby animal will be. Volcano eruptions [are being examined](https://phys.org/news/2023-10-volcanic-eruptions-dampen-indian-ocean.html) to determine their historical and future impact on El Niño. 

The 154-page [Forest Declaration](https://forestdeclaration.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/2023ForestDeclarationAssessment1.pdf) for 2023 was released, and it confirms what we already know: **efforts to stop deforestation by 2030 are impossible** (unless we run out of forests by then), forest **emissions are growing, biodiversity is dying, rainfall is decreasing.**

A [**gas shortage in Ghana**](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-africa-67236078) resulted in a temporary nationwide blackout. **Drought** (worsened by El Niño) is forcing [Ecuador to cut electricity](https://archive.ph/CgOTr) for a few hours every day because hydropower plants aren’t producing as much as expected. Cuts are expected to last into December. Siemens Energy [is getting a bailout](https://www.theguardian.com/business/2023/oct/26/siemens-energy-shares-plunge-as-it-seeks-government-bailout) from the German government because of [problems in its wind power](https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2023/oct/27/is-crisis-at-siemens-energy-symptom-of-a-wider-wind-power-problem) output.

 Earl of Shaftesbury would like to transfer Lough Neagh ownership,55,northernireland,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c9777yg08y1o,1719209501.0,"Earl of Shaftesbury Nicolas Ashley-Cooper says any transfer ""may take time""
The Earl of Shaftesbury has said he would like to transfer his estate's ownership of Lough Neagh ""into a charity or community trust model, with rights of nature included"".

But Nicholas Ashley-Cooper, said the proposal “may take time”.
It comes as the Lough Neagh Report is due to come before the Stormont Executive again later next week.

Writing on the online platform Substack, the earl said he felt he was ""an easy target and a useful excuse for failings in proper governance"".

The Shaftesbury Estate owns the bed of Lough Neagh and the earl has previously said he was willing to explore options.
'No entity who can improve health of lough'

Following the blue-green algal crisis of Summer 2023, there have been calls to transfer the lough to public ownership in Northern Ireland.

But in his article, the earl asks ""to whom?"".
He added there is ""currently no entity that is offering to take it or who can guarantee to improve the environmental health of the lough.""

While the Shaftesbury Estate holds the rights to the bed of the lough, five companies have been granted licences to extract sand for which they pay a royalty to the estate.

The earl acknowledged that ""unauthorised and therefore completely unregulated and illegal sand extraction"" had been taking place for a number of years.

He said the estate had made ""repeated attempts"" to try to stop it.

Nicholas Ashley-Cooper said the Estate's Lough Neagh Ltd. company ""has no control"" over the water in the lough and the nutrients that go into it.

He added that ""collective action"" was needed to find solutions to the issues facing the lough.

The earl describes the current situation of Lough Neagh as ""deeply upsetting"" and added that a charity or community trust model with rights of nature included as possibly ""the best way"" to support the Lough's long-term future.

Queen's University Belfast (QUB) lecturer Peter Doran of the All-Island Rights of Nature Caucus welcomed the earl’s statement.

""As an advocate of a rights of nature approach and community-ownership, I'm hopeful that other stakeholders, including the executive, will now collaborate on a challenging transition, a just transition,"" he said.

""The challenge is to re-imagine a novel community-led restoration in which the lough itself and its multitude of life systems are meaningfully included as part of that rights-bearing community.""

He added: ""The lough is not a mere object for extraction and exploitation but a subject of our shared history.

""The new chapter must be one of collaboration, recognising that our fate as a community is deeply entangled with the fate of nature. We once knew this. It is time to embrace that insight once again.""

What are Rights of Nature?
Rights of Nature is a legal theory that seeks to grant rights to elements of nature to protect them from harm and allow them to flourish.

In the Republic of Ireland, the government has been asked to consider a referendum on the issue.

It is understood that the Lough Neagh Report commissioned by the Department of Agriculture, Environment and Rural Affairs does not examine ownership of the lough as part of the immediate solutions required.

The executive discussed the report in its most recent meeting, and minister Andrew Muir has urged ministerial colleagues to approve it at the next meeting.","[""But then stormont would have to actually start to take responsibility for the lake rather than complaining that its someone else's problem."", ""I imagine he wakes up and most mornings and gets notifications telling him where he is mentioned and in what news stories and he is getting sick of it.\n\nSay what you will about people inheriting land in Ireland they shouldn't have but this guy has been pretty open to dialogue when he could have been some silent 80 year old represented by three law firms so we should be thankful he wants to engage imo\n\nNot really sure what issue the ownership fixes as the pollution is being caused by something the Government already have control over but I do agree something like the Lough Neagh should be public."", '[The aforementioned substack post by the Earl.](https://nickashleycooper.substack.com/p/thoughts-on-lough-neagh) Well worth the full read in my opinion.']",0.08604617604617605,0.3453831970498637,1

Anna Lo obituary,79,northernireland,https://www.reddit.com/r/northernireland/comments/1h5kei4/anna_lo_obituary/,1733221462.0,"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2024/dec/02/anna-lo-obituary

Northern Ireland’s first minority ethnic elected representative who helped create a new anti-racial discrimation law
Pádraig Belton
Mon 2 Dec 2024 17.37 GMT

Anna Lo, who has died aged 74 of cancer, was Northern Ireland’s first minority ethnic elected representative. She represented South Belfast for the Alliance party in the Northern Ireland Assembly from 2007 to 2016.

There she established all-party groups on subjects ranging from ethnic minorities to human trafficking. Having been a founding commissioner in the Equality Commission for Northern Ireland in 1999, she led calls for Peter Robinson, the first minister, to apologise in 2014 after he defended a pastor who called Islam “satanic”. His executive then published a draft racial equality strategy for which Lo had lobbied.

As environment committee chair, she helped compel the environment minister Mark Durkan to restore NGOs’ funding after budget cuts. She inserted language in the marine bill requiring the Department of Environment to promote sustainable development. On abortion rights, she pushed, successfully, for guidelines clarifying Northern Ireland’s abortion law for healthcare professionals.

Lo’s entry into politics happened quite unexpectedly. A trained social worker, she had spent many years in community work and from 1997 was director of the Chinese Welfare Association. One morning in December 2006, the Alliance party deputy leader, Naomi Long, arrived at her office and asked her to stand in south Belfast for the Assembly elections in March 2007.

Northern Ireland had never had a non-white politician. Rightwing critics questioned whether, as a non-native, she was qualified. But after winning the seat, she was the first legislator other than the Speaker to speak in the new assembly, calling on it to value the contributions of minority ethnic communities and reject racism.

    She was deputy chair of the standards and privileges committee during the investigations of Peter Robinson and his wife Iris

In 2011, she won re-election, topping the poll and doubling her first-preference total. She took on the environment committee’s chairmanship, to which she added the deputy chairmanship of the standards and privileges committee, during contentious investigations of Robinson and his wife Iris.

Born in Hong Kong, Anna – whose Chinese birth-name was Man-Wah – was the daughter of Lo Ping-Fai, a civil servant who later worked for a shipping company after developing tuberculosis, and Wai Kam-Ping, granddaughter of a wealthy merchant with businesses in China, Hong Kong and Honolulu. Little of the family fortune remained, and when Man-Wah was six, her family moved to new low-rent housing on Hong Kong’s northeast coast.

Her early years were spent in her grandparents’ family home in Wan Chai with her five siblings – and her parents teaching ballroom dancing in their lounge.

After leaving Shaukeiwan technical school, Lo undertook clerical work, and then became a personal assistant at an advertising company. At a cousin’s wedding banquet, she met the Belfast journalist David Watson, who was about to join the South China Morning Post.

In 1974 she went to London and enrolled in a three-month secretarial course in Earl’s Court. She began a relationship with Watson, who returned home to work at the Belfast Telegraph. When the Home Office rejected Lo’s work-permit application, Watson suggested getting married.

She moved to Belfast five months after the Ulster Workers’ Council strike brought down the first power-sharing executive in 1974. The couple lived in east Belfast, near the Rev Ian Paisley, and Lo found work as secretary to the editor of the local agricultural newspaper Farmweek.

In 1976 Lo joined BBC Northern Ireland as a production secretary, and eventually the World Service. Besides affording a chance to meet politicians (Paisley joked to her in the lift about his dieting successes), it led to her recording features for the BBC’s Chinese External Services about the Chinese community and the Peace People organisation, founded that year by Mairead Corrigan-Maguire and Betty Williams.

She established an evening English class in 1978 for Chinese immigrants at Rupert Stanley College, where her mother-in-law lectured. This grew into a social hub for immigrants who rarely ventured out from home and work, with weekend expeditions to the Giant’s Causeway. When Lo met a senior police officer at a dinner party it led to her being invited to translate for Chinese speakers for the Royal Ulster Constabulary’s aliens department.

In 1987, she became an interpreter in the Chinese Welfare Association (CWA) in south Belfast. Then, after studying at the University of Ulster, she became Northern Ireland’s first minority ethnic social worker. She was in a new Chinese Health Project formed by the CWA and Barnardo’s, and helped found Chinese women’s groups in Belfast and Craigavon.

Her career went from strength to strength. As vice-chair of a new Northern Ireland Council for Ethnic Minorities in 1994, she successfully lobbied for a Race Relations (Northern Ireland) Order 1997, prohibiting discrimination in the workplace, housing or public services – the UK’s 1976 Race Relations Act had exempted Northern Ireland. In 2000 she was appointed MBE.

As director she professionalised the CWA, overseeing the construction of a £1.4m Chinese Resource Centre, opened in 2011, and a 41-unit sheltered housing scheme.

Lo’s political career ended almost as suddenly as it began. The experience of encountering a group of abusive loyalists in an east Belfast shopping centre in 2014, two months after she called the Northern Irish border “artificial”, convinced her not to stand in the 2016 elections.

Her first marriage ended eventually in divorce. In 2010 she married Gavin Millar, a former fireman. They divorced the following year.

She is survived by her partner, Robert Barry, the sons from her first marriage, Conall and Owen, her siblings Henry and Mary, and two grandchildren.","['If only the north had more Anna Los.

Sorry for causing the Dansco album shortage....Part 3 [243 Albums + Two Discoveries!],274,coins,https://www.reddit.com/r/coins/comments/12jxa07/sorry_for_causing_the_dansco_album_shortagepart_3/,1681329946.0,"What started out as a small album collection for my coins has turned into a full-fledged preservation project as I dove into the history of the Dansco Corporation and its storied history in numismatics and coin preservation. I have previously documented my journey in two prior posts...

[Part 1 \[January 2022\]](https://www.reddit.com/r/coins/comments/s44262/sorry_for_causing_the_dansco_album_shortage/)

[Part 2 \[August 2022\]](https://www.reddit.com/r/coins/comments/wjdvki/sorry_for_causing_the_dansco_album_shortage_part_2/)

...and my collection has since jumped up to [240+ albums](https://imgur.com/a/diRJxM3)! I made it my goal to collect and preserve one of every Dansco album ever created. During this journey, I made two interesting discoveries. The first was that Dansco was the original manufacturer of the United Nations F.A.O. albums during the 1970s. The second is Dansco's connection with Nevada's Casinos' transition from silver dollars to gaming tokens.

&#x200B;

**UN FAO Albums**

The United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization used to run a [program](https://www.fao-coins.info/) where they coordinated with UN members to produce coins specifically to bring attention to worldwide food insecurity. Dansco produced a [variety of colorful albums](https://imgur.com/a/SArBPj6) for the UN and collectors. I only learned of this when reviewing an old pdf report from the UN FAO office where the commissioner was [warning](https://imgur.com/a/0e4nQc7) collectors about Dansco being six months behind production. \[Some things never change!\] Photos of the albums are detailed further below.

**Casinos and the Silver Crisis**

The second discovery was that Dansco worked with the Franklin Mint and Nevada Casinos in 1965 & 1966. As the United States was moving away from using silver in circulating currency, Casinos faced a crisis as they had relied on patrons using silver dollars. With silver being withdrawn, Casinos found themselves with patrons who would rather hold onto silver dollars than spend it. Casinos worked with the Nevada State Government and the Franklin Mint to move over to non-silver Gaming Tokens. To commemorate this occasion, Dansco was commissioned to produce albums in [1965](https://imgur.com/a/sfD1eUY) and [1966](https://imgur.com/a/tmc4Ls2) to house the first 500 Silver Proof Tokens, 500 Full-Proof Tokens, and 500 Proof-Like Tokens. These albums were then given to politicians, casino owners, and those who were instrumental in this transition.

Dansco's connection with Nevada Casinos and the United Nations has been lost to time. Very little mention of it can be found online. But now it is known again :)

&#x200B;

**My Collection**

In the details below, I have documented every single album in my collection with photos of every page. The process took me a few months to comb through and document each album. My hope is that this can serve as a resource for collectors who want to see which Dansco albums are out there and what the insides of each album look like. You'll notice some oddities such as albums labeled for the Littleton company and Federal Coin Fund, along with a few custom albums Dansco has produced over the years. Along with some custom albums I've made myself. Enjoy!

In England there's been changes in age and ethnic demographics as well as population growth, it has also became more religiously and culturally diverse as well.

The UK has also undergone changes to the structure of its economy as well, it has not changed as much as it's population structure or ethnic composition since 2001, as the UK is approaching a post-industrial era the country is looking to be economically and environmentally sustainable.

In the past, the UK economy was based on activities that took place in the UK but also within Commonwealth countries. But with the growth of Globalisation the UK economy is now more dependent on other countries, one example of this is the manufacturing industry. In the 1900s around 55% of the population worked in secondary jobs. In the last few years the percentage has dropped to around 15%, globalisation has allowed the UK to connect with other countries in the world and made it possible to send orders abroad, locate factories abroad and get products from outside the UK shipped into UK ports. 

Not only has changes happened in other parts of the UK, in Ireland as well there's been some changes.

Although there is different circumstances, parts of Ireland were impacted by partition such as County Donegal, Donegal was economically separated from its natural regional economic centre of Derry. The railway network struggled to operate across two different economic areas.

The economy of the Republic after partition was much weaker than that of the new Northern Ireland statelet and was based around agriculture, where as the north had industries based on shipbuilding. 

However it is believed today that the Irish republic is now in better shape and wealthier than the North.

It’s Halloween week, with decorations in every store, in every neighborhood, work events, and school functions, the question often comes up—especially among younger Christians: is it okay as a Christian to celebrate Halloween?

Let's cover the history behind Halloween and the many layers of what has led to the modern celebration of Halloween.

# What is Halloween

In pre-Christian Ireland and Scotland, there was a Celtic celebration by the Druids that took place between the midpoint of the fall equinox and winter solstice, this day was called Samhain (pronounced “sow-in” or “sah-win”).

Over time as the Gregorian Calendar caught on throughout the western world (which is based on the solar calendar), October 31st began to be the commonly accepted date to celebrate Samhain, prior to this the celebration was observed by following the lunar calendar and following agricultural cycles marking the end of harvest.

The celebration of Samhain marked the beginning of the “dark” half of the year and the end of the harvest season. It marked the beginning of winter and the time associated with death and the fading of life.

The ancient Celts believed that on this night the veil between the living world and the spirit world was thin. Allowing for both benevolent spirits and malevolent spirits to cross over. To protect themselves and their communities people performed various rituals.

## Rituals Observed
- Large fires were lit on hilltops to ward off evil spirits and honor the gods. People would often take flames from these bonfires to relight their hearths at home for protection from spirits.
- Livestock were slaughtered to prepare for the winter, and portions of the harvest were offered to spirits as gifts to ensure protection through the colder months.
- People would wear costumes made of animal skins to disguise themselves from wandering spirits or to blend in, so harmful spirits would pass them by.
- People carved large turnips into lanterns to ward off evil spirits.
- People used this special time to perform divination rituals, seeking to predict the future, especially regarding the winter, harvest, and community prosperity.
- There was a focus on honoring ancestors, with families sometimes setting places at the table or leaving food offerings for deceased loved ones.

# Origin of the Name ""Halloween""
In the 4th century AD it began to be common practice among Christians to dedicate specific days to remember and honor dead martyrs who had died for their faith.

Due to the growing number of martyrs, it eventually became difficult to commemorate each individually and communities began celebrating them collectively. Between 731 AD - 741 AD, Pope Gregory III dedicated a chapel in St. Peters Basilica in Rome to “all saints,” officially assigning November 1st as a day to honor them in Rome. This formalized a collective feast to celebrate saints throughout the Christian world. By the 9th century however, Pope Gregory the IV ordered its observance throughout the Western Church.

All Saints Day served in Medieval Europe and even presently today among Catholic Christians as a day of gratitude and reverence for those who led exemplary Christian lives. It focuses not only on canonized saints but also on ordinary Christians who have passed on and are in the presence of God. The day is traditionally marked by Church services, prayers and by some traditions, visiting cemeteries to honor dead loved ones.

The name Halloween comes from “All Hallow’s Eve,” which is the evening before All Hallow’s Day. “Hallow” is an old English word for saint or holy person, so “All Hallow’s Day” is the day dedicated to honoring all saints. In medieval times, the evening before All Hallows Day was called “All Hallow’s Eve.” Over time the name was shortened with All Hallows’ Eve to becoming Hallowe’en, eventually just spelled Halloween.

# Arrival In America
As Irish and Scottish immigrants came over to America in the mid 1800’s, largely driven by economic hardship. The majority of Irish immigrants fled to America during the Great Irish Famine that lasted from 1845 to 1852.

A massive potato blight destroyed much of Ireland’s staple crop, leading to mass starvation. With little aid from the British government, over a million Irish people died, and another million emigrated to escape the famine, with America as a primary destination.

Scottish immigrants fled to America during the same time due to oppressive government policies in the Scottish Highlands. In the Scottish Highlands, the Highland Clearances led to the forced eviction of tenant farmers as landowners shifted to more profitable sheep farming. Similarly, in Ireland, small tenant farmers faced high rents and harsh land tenure systems, leaving many destitute.

These hardships led many to seek a new life in America, where they hoped to find greater economic opportunities and freedom from the oppression and poverty they had faced in their homeland.

By the 19th century, most Irish and Scottish immigrants identified as Christians—primarily Roman Catholic in Ireland and a mix of Catholic, Presbyterian, and Anglican in Scotland.

While the majority were Christians in name, many held onto folk traditions with ancient roots, especially those tied to the cycles of nature and the supernatural, which had connections to pre-Christian Celtic beliefs.

###### Irish Catholics and Folk Traditions
Even as Christians, Irish Catholics retained a strong oral tradition and seasonal customs, some of which had pagan origins. Practices around Samhain, like lighting candles to guide spirits or carving turnips into lanterns to ward off evil, were deeply ingrained cultural habits that continued alongside Christian observances.

###### Scottish Highlanders and the Gaelic Influence
In the Scottish Highlands, Gaelic-speaking communities kept alive folklore and seasonal festivals with ancient Celtic ties. Samhain was still a known time of year when people engaged in divination, storytelling, and protective rituals, even though they identified as Christians. They might have viewed these customs as cultural practices rather than religious rituals, blending them with Christian beliefs. To do such things is by no means Christian, and scripture warns that such who do these things will not inherit the Kingdom of God (Galatians 5:19-21,1 Corinthians 6:9-10,Revelation 21:7-8,Revelation 22:15)

###### Cunning Folk and Folk Healers
Some individuals, often known as “cunning folk,” acted as folk healers and protectors against the supernatural. These figures, found in both Irish and Scottish communities often practiced folk magic and charms and were sought after for protection, healing, and guidance on supernatural matters. Those who practiced such things, again - called themselves Christians, but scripture warns us against this.

While Christianity was the primary faith, folk customs, fear of spirits, and respect for ancient festivals persisted. This mix of Christian and folk practices contributed to the fatal traditions that Irish and Scottish immigrants brought to America, shaping the development of holidays like Halloween.

# Origin of ""Trick or Treat""
While the phrase “trick or treat” comes from modern day 20th century North America, it has its roots that go far back to Europe. The practice began in Medieval Europe where poor people would go “souling” on All Hallows' Day offering prayers for the dead in exchange for food. In Ireland and Scotland the practice of “guising” involved children dressing up in costumes and performing tricks, songs or jokes to earn treats, which came over to America with the Scottish and Irish immigrants.

The first recorded use of the term “trick or treat” was recorded in a Canadian newspaper in 1927 in Alberta, where a local newspaper described children visiting homes for treats, threatening harmless “tricks” if they received nothing. This playful demand for treats eventually became a halloween standard all across North America by mid 20th century. It encapsulated a lighthearted choice for households - “give us treats in order to avoid minor pranks.”

# Lutheran Impact
Lutherans, particularly in Germany during the reformation contributed to Halloween traditions by observing “Reformation Day” on October 31st. Reformation Day commemorating Martin Luther’s posting of his 95 Theses to the Church door in Wittenberg in 1517.

This historic event is often seen as the start of the Protestant Reformation. Luther chose this date intentionally as it was the eve of All Saints Day, which is a major feast day in the Catholic Church in order to provoke theological discussion on the catholic practices of selling indulgences and other Church practices that led to Protestantism.

Reformation Day as an Alternative Celebration. In Germany and other Protestant regions, Reformation Day became a focal celebration on October 31. This offered a theological alternative to Halloween, focusing on the Protestant message of faith, grace, and reform rather than on spirits, saints, or purgatory. Over time, Lutherans and other Protestant groups have viewed October 31 as a day to celebrate religious freedom and the Bible's authority over traditional customs related to All Hallows' Eve.

In many Protestant circles its common to provide alternative halloween activities where children can instead dress up as Bible characters and many churches will host some form of a gathering for children to have fun at, like renting bounce houses or having carnival style games with biblical themes.

# Is it Okay to Celebrate Halloween?
Since we have covered most of the history behind Halloween, the question that must be answered then is can a Christian celebrate Halloween?

The answer is a resounding no.

Halloween is dominated by the traditions of ancient Samhain, it literally keeps alive the detestable practices of the pagan Celts and Druids, re-introducing witchcraft to each generation.

Even if you aren't celebrating it with those things in mind, like dressing up on October 31st - it keeps the ancient tradition of Celts dressing up trying to ward off evil spirits in memory, year after year.

God warned the Israelites in several places,

>'Do not bow down before their gods or worship them or follow their practices. You must demolish them and break their sacred stones to pieces. Worship the Lord your God, and his blessing will be on your food and water. I will take away sickness from among you, ' - Exodus 23:24-25 NIV

The key phrase is, “… or follow their practices.”

The underscored statement is that we are to reject the worship practices of those outside of God’s ways. Samhain was a worship practice geared around the fear and worship of demons. While the majority of people do not think of Halloween in this light, that’s where the physical activities that take place leading up to Halloween is based around.

God was speaking this commandment to ancient Israel about nations He had given 490 years to repent, and He was dispossessing the Canaanites of their land and giving it to the Israelites. We are prohibited in the new testament from stealing, or destroying other peoples property, but we are to vehemently oppose any pagan practices (see scriptures like Acts 19:37, Romans 13:7, 1 Peter 2:17, and Matthew 5:44).

One of the biggest lessons we learn in the Old Testament is the consequences of not only tolerating, but participating in pagan practices

> ""They rejected His statutes and His covenant... and they followed vanity and became vain, and went after the nations around them, concerning whom the Lord had commanded them not to do like them."" - 2 Kings 17:15

When God's people begin to do like the people in the surrounding nations, instead of living as separated and Holy unto Him, God says His people become vain. They adopted worthless or empty practices and beliefs.

The two primary practices of dressing up on October 31st and carving pumpkins have their origin directly in the fear and worship of demons.

We are told in the New Testament

>""Therefore, my beloved, flee from idolatry... You cannot drink the cup of the Lord and the cup of demons; you cannot partake of the table of the Lord and the table of demons."" - 1 Corinthians 10:14-22

Anything that is associated with the occult, superstition, or practices that glorify darkness we are commanded not to partake in.

> 'What harmony is there between Christ and Belial? Or what does a believer have in common with an unbeliever? What agreement is there between the temple of God and idols? For we are the temple of the living God. As God has said: “I will live with them and walk among them, and I will be their God, and they will be my people.” Therefore, “Come out from them and be separate, says the Lord. Touch no unclean thing, and I will receive you.” And, “I will be a Father to you, and you will be my sons and daughters, says the Lord Almighty.”' - 2 Corinthians 6:15-18 NIV

Because we are the temple of God, we are to come out from dark practices of the world and be separated to Him

> 'For you were once darkness, but now you are light in the Lord. Live as children of light (for the fruit of the light consists in all goodness, righteousness and truth) and find out what pleases the Lord. Have nothing to do with the fruitless deeds of darkness, but rather expose them. ' - Ephesians 5:8-11 NIV

We are to avoid activities associated with spiritual darkness, Halloween emphasizes themes like fear, death and occult symbolisms. Christians are to avoid these things altogether.

> 'Do not conform to the pattern of this world, but be transformed by the renewing of your mind. Then you will be able to test and approve what God’s will is—his good, pleasing and perfect will. ' - Romans 12:2 NIV

We are not to be conformed to the festivities of the world, we are to change our ways of thinking to match God's ways.

> 'Finally, brothers and sisters, whatever is true, whatever is noble, whatever is right, whatever is pure, whatever is lovely, whatever is admirable—if anything is excellent or praiseworthy—think about such things. ' - Philippians 4:8 NIV

Christians are to give themselves to things that are wholesome and uplifting, Halloween is given over to themes of fear and darkness, the complete opposite of Christian values.

# How About Trick or Treating?

As we showed before, the origin of ""trick or treating"" is literally mischief making. Is this a practice that should be memorialized every year by Christians? You have no ability to control what the world does, but is this a value or phrase we want to promote among Christian kids?

If you teach your kids that its okay to use words like ""trick or treat"", someone is going to one day think about the words they are saying. Just remember, 'Flesh gives birth to flesh, but the Spirit gives birth to spirit. ' - John 3:6

Mischief making is called stirring up trouble, it's the opposite of peace, kindness and self control, fruits of the Spirit (Galatians 5:22-23).

> 'There are six things the Lord hates, seven that are detestable to him: haughty eyes, a lying tongue, hands that shed innocent blood, a heart that devises wicked schemes, feet that are quick to rush into evil, a false witness who pours out lies and a person who stirs up conflict in the community. ' - Proverbs 6:16-19 NIV

Is this the kind of phrase we want to teach our children is okay to use, when its something that will enable mischief and sin in their lives later? It's something associated with darkness, remember God told us to have nothing to do with the fruitless works of darkness, but instead to expose them (Ephesians 5:8-11).

# Some Important Things to Note
Many years ago I met a witch, unfortunately I'm pretty sure she went back to it, for a very long time friends of mine and myself would confront this person - calling them to repent. God even confronted them Himself, she saw an open eyed vision of her hands stained in blood, and He showed Himself powerful in confronting her.

What I remember of this person though is every single year when Halloween would come around, to them it was like Christmas and Easter rolled into one. They looked forward to the darkness. They wanted to be up all night. To them it was a time of witchcraft. It was vile, it was detestable, it was evil.

That's what this day means to literal witches and satanists. Is this a day that any Christian ANYWHERE should be associated with? no. And because this person was lukewarm, and clung to the darkness with one foot in and one foot out, the darkness overtook her. God calls you not just to come out a little bit from the darkness found in the world, but to come out entirely.

The founder of the Church of Satan, Anton LaVey once said, ""I'm glad that Christian parents let their children worship the devil at least one night out of the year.""

It doesn't matter if you think it's innocent fun, the darkness doesn't treat it that way. You allowing your kids to inch their way towards the edge during the Halloween season is literally allowing them take a few steps closer Satanists.

Evil is as evil does, and those who are truly practicing evil - love Halloween.

# Follow Timothy's Example
Paul's assistant, Timothy was a powerful example of how we are to treat pagan festivals. in 97 AD Timothy was serving as the Bishop of Ephesus, when the time of the pagan Festival of Artemis came around, Timothy courageously called the revelers to repentance, urging them to turn away from their idolatry.

His bold actions were met with fierce opposition, the angry mob reportedly beat Timothy with clubs, ultimately leading to his death.

# Follow Saint Patricks Example
Saint Patrick was no stranger to the practices of the Druids, he took his own life in his hands and carried the Gospel to them.

There was another celebration of the spring solstice similar to Samhain, called the festival of Bealtaine. The Celtic festival of Bealtaine celebrated the coming of summer and was a sacred time in Ireland when the Druids and chieftains gathered on the Hill of Tara to light a great bonfire in honor of their gods. The lighting of this bonfire marked the official start of the festival, and it was forbidden to ignite any other fire before this ritual bonfire was lit.

On the same night, Saint Patrick prepared to celebrate Easter with his followers nearby on the Hill of Slane, within sight of Tara. As part of the Easter vigil, he lit a Paschal fire, a traditional Christian symbol of Christ's resurrection. This act was a direct challenge to the Druids’ authority and their prohibition on other fires during the Bealtaine festival.

When the Druids saw Patrick’s fire on the Hill of Slane, they were enraged. They recognized it as a direct defiance of their customs and warned the High King, Laoghaire (Lóegaire mac Néill), that if Patrick’s fire was not extinguished, it would outshine their own and spread throughout Ireland. The Druids believed Patrick was invoking a powerful force, one that could potentially rival or even eclipse the influence of their own gods.

Patrick was summoned to the Hill of Tara, where the king and the Druids awaited him. Patrick fearlessly confronted the Druids, proclaiming the power of Christ over their pagan deities. The Druids attempted to challenge Patrick with their magic, but he countered them through prayer, and some stories even describe miraculous signs that accompanied him, causing several Druids to convert or flee.

This event marked a turning point for Patrick’s mission in Ireland. His bravery in defying the Druids and his demonstration of faith reportedly won over some of the Irish chieftains and their subjects. Although the High King did not convert, he allowed Patrick to continue his work, which eventually led to widespread acceptance of Christianity in Ireland.

# What Can You Do?
Well, for one - find something else to do on Halloween. Gather with your Church, celebrate something else like Reformation Day. Refuse to participate in any practices that are associated with Halloween - even if it means treating it like any other night and doing nothing.

Expose works of darkness, and call people to the purity of heart only found in Jesus

> 'Abstain from all appearance of evil. ' 1 Thessalonians 5:22

Anything that might seem ungodly or associated with evil, do not participate in it. Do not decorate your house or things with ghouls, ghosts, or skulls. These are the very things which dominate the minds of the pagan world, they are fearful of death, and fearful of demons. Instead let your life magnify life and peace, not fear and death.

> ""The images of their gods you are to burn in the fire. Do not covet the silver and gold on them, and do not take it for yourselves, or you will be ensnared by it, for it is detestable to the Lord your God. Do not bring a detestable thing into your house or you, like it, will be set apart for destruction."" - Deuteronomy 7:25-26

Instead make your house something set apart for God, if you are going to place symbolisms around your home - make them be things that will point people to God.

> ""These commandments that I give you today are to be on your hearts. Impress them on your children. Talk about them when you sit at home and when you walk along the road, when you lie down and when you get up. Tie them as symbols on your hands and bind them on your foreheads. Write them on the doorframes of your houses and on your gates."" - Deuteronomy 6:6-9

It's up to you if you want to hand out candy to children coming to your door, but use the opportunity to share Jesus. Meet parents that are coming to your door, give out Bible tracts, do something that is contrary to the spirit operating behind the culture of halloween, lead people toward Jesus instead.

This is a implied link made by some people based simply on the false assumption that they happen on the same day. \n\n> October 31st began to be the commonly accepted date to celebrate Samhain\n\nThis is not actually true. the Gregorian calendar is a relatively modern invention, there was no real evidence of Samhain being practices in Scotland (Ireland is a little different but you mentioned both and the implication is its the same). Harvest season is quite normal and not pagan, spiritual practice can be, like Samhain. however, even with the introduction of the new calendar, harvest related things still revolved around seasonal changes, not the calendar, and so Samhain has never been on the same day as halloween. \n\neven today i dont think neo-pagans follow the new calendar. \n\n> The ancient Celts believed that on this night the veil between the living world and the spirit world was thin. Allowing for both benevolent spirits and malevolent spirits to cross over. To protect themselves and their communities people performed various rituals.\n\nThere are no pre-christian sources that mention thin places, this idea only first appears in a Christian context. It gained popularity in Celtic Christianity, but is very much a Christian thing, there are no links to druids or paganism. there is no concept of good and bad spirits crossing thin places. Suggestions of these things are as far as ive seen neo-pagan in origin. \n\n> livestock were slaughtered to prepare for the winter, and portions of the harvest were offered to spirits as gifts to ensure protection through the colder months.\n\nkilling livestock for winder isnt a ritual, its standard practice to survive over winter. Similarly the harvest offering your mention is grain harvest. and the offering is actually more a agricultural thing than spiritual. some grain would be left on the field mainly to allow for seen propagation. some spiritual things would be incorporated by some later, but their not druid in origin or related to halloween. they appear in the 18th century. \n\n> Over time the name was shortened with All Hallows’ Eve to becoming Hallowe’en, eventually just spelled Halloween.\n\nYou didnt mention, but interesting bit of into 'een from hallow'een is actually a Scots word for evening. hence all saints evening becomes hallow'een \n\nI could go on with a few more problematic interpretations of history in your post, but i think you get my point. \n\nThere is a problem with people re-interpreting Celtic history and culture to fit particular narratives people want, and some particular themes have becomes popular over the years and people think they're true. What makes it worse is the incorporation of partially true things, with partial mis-information makes it hard for people to knwo whats true and false. it looks legitimate and convincing as a result, but in reality its butchering Celtic culture and Celtic Christianity, and Christian history. \n\nthe reality is that its a lot more nuanced, and a lot of assumptions made are not actually based in real information or actual Celtic culture as it happened."", 'As you mentioned, Halloween is just a shortening of All Hallows’ Eve, a Christian holiday, so again, why can’t we celebrate it? As for dressing in costumes being purely pagan, that’s false, in some medieval churches, when a relic of a saint was not available, parishioners would dress as saints to honor them during feast days.']",0.04281807636807637,0.4473175491175494,1

##Known Issues:

The following are issues with the current build which our team is already aware of; we do not require additional reports on these issues. You can learn more about reporting a bug during this preview [HERE](https://steamcommunity.com/app/1466860/discussions/4/3190242354884859505/)!

* **Mod Britain & Ireland Missing Relics & Fish** 
 We are aware that the official in-house mod, Britain & Ireland (see below), is missing relics which can impact civs that rely heavily on them. The generated map also is not spawning deep-water fish, and only a limited amount of shoreline fish. We are tracking this issue and do not require any additional reports.

Please also be aware of our list of [General Known Issues for Age of Empires IV](https://support.ageofempires.com/hc/en-us/articles/4408424670484-Known-Issues-Solutions)[support.ageofempires.com] - we do not require additional reports of issues listed there that are not specifically addressed in this update preview.


###Content Creator Known Issues
These known issues specifically only impact the Content Creator for those users who have been granted access.

* **Content Creator Displays ""Unresponsive"" While Saving Mods** After saving a mod or clicking Finish to create a mod, the Content Creator will go ""Unresponsive"" for a short period of time. Please be patient and let the tool continue to think for a few minutes. This issue should resolve itself in that time.

* **Tuning Pack Incorrectly Called Attribute Mod on Some Menus** While navigating through the Content Creator, some menues and pop-ups may refer to an ""Attribute Mod"". This text should instead refer to the Tuning Pack mod-type. This is a text-string error and should not impact tool-use or gameplay.

* **Terrain Layout Tool Generates Mirrored Maps** We are aware of an issue with the Terrain Layout Tool used when making Crafted Maps. The tool will always generate maps that are mirrored along the y-axis or z-axis randomly, even when trying to generate non-symmetrical maps. We are tracking this issue and do not require any additional reports.

#Maps Changelog

##General Changes

##1v1 Resource Spawn Tuning
* 1v1 (Micro) map size resource balancing has received a pass, with the goal of improving the distribution of resources between players.
 * On open maps, like Lipany and Dry Arabia, this has meant objects like relics, gold deposits and stone deposits are now spawning in a tighter band for each player, to cut down on cases where one resource node would spawn considerably further away for one player than for the other. We are always tweaking and looking to improve this, so keep sending us screenshots and map seeds when you feel things are generated unfairly!
 * On divided maps, like Mountain Pass and Mongolian Heights, we have done additional custom tuning for several maps to help ensure that the dividing geography does not separate one player from their allotment of resource deposits. We were seeing instances of, for example, both players' large gold deposits spawning on the same side of the mountain range on Mountain Pass. This was due to how we place resources within a central band of map area that is calculated based on pathfinding distance from each player's TC to each point on the map. In cases like Mountain Pass, if one player spawns closer to the opening, the ""midpoint"" between players would be on one side of the mountain range, and our contested resources would be placed there. This set of tuning has been about finding new constraints for this banding on maps with dividing geography. Danube River, Boulder Bay, Confluence, Mountain Pass, Mongolian Heights and Nagari all received custom tuning in this regard.
* Relics will now spawn in a more balanced configuration – one accessible relic per player, 3 centrally contested relics. This updated balance logic has been applied globally to all map sizes, and tuned specifically for several maps on the Micro (1v1) size. Additional tuning for divided maps at larger sizes will be coming in a later update. Relics have been tuned to spawn further away from each other.
* Divided maps have had custom tuning and will spawn 1 accessible relic and 2 contested relics per “side” of the map, for a total of 6 relics. This was done to ensure that maps in which terrain gives natural ownership to one player don’t have a built-in imbalance due to the nature of spawning an odd number of contestable objects. The maps that include these relic changes are:
 * Confluence
 * Mountain Pass
 * Mongolian Heights
 * Nagari
* Small gold and stone deposits have had their contested spawn range tightened. One contested small gold and stone will now spawn per player (up from only one overall), with less likelihood that it will be too close to a single player.
* Sacred Sites have had their spawn parameters narrowed to help them spawn evenly across the center of the map on maps where their locations are not being specifically placed by the map script (e.g. on the hill on King of the Hill).

________________________________________

##Specific Map Changes
###Nagari
* Mountain ranges have been shortened slightly to provide a more consistent central lake and mountain configuration.
* Deep water fish have been removed from the side ponds and concentrated in the central lake. This was to both remove instances of unbalanced amounts of safe fish and ensure that the most valuable fish are located in a contested part of the map.
* Relic count has been increased to spawn a base 4 relics plus one per player to better ensure fairness of distribution on maps where geography can divide the map into discrete sections
* Resource spawning for 1v1 Micro size matches has had custom tuning done on various resource deposits. Our goal with this pass was to cut down on perceived unbalanced map generations, especially on maps where map geography can divide the map into discrete sections. Resources like gold deposits should now spawn more squarely in each player's ""side"" of the map, to avoid instances where a central, contested deposit could be placed on the wrong ""side"" of the central geography.

###Black Forest
* The ""forest-y"" ness of Black Forest has been reigned in to not spawn unchoppable trees in the middle of your Town Center courtyards
* Trade Posts on Micro and Small map sizes have been adjusted to spawn closer to the exact center of the map to help ensure more equal access
* Spawn reliability of the second deer herd per player has been improved
* Sacred Sites have been re-added to Black Forest. We have been watching for your feedback on this change, so thanks to everyone who gave us their thoughts on the Black Forest Sacred Sites. With the way Age IV plays, Sacred Sites provide a valuable way for players to counter a locked-in defensive strategy. While we appreciate the epic slugfests that remind us of classic Age of Empires II Black Forest gameplay, we feel like the Sacred Sites play well in the Age of Empires IV version of the map.

###Boulder Bay
* We have updated the forest distribution to include more smaller forests, as opposed to fewer, larger forests. This is to help prevent instances of large forests completely blocking players in on one side of the bay.
* We’ve updated the fish distribution in the bay to be more even. We are also working to provide a more robust solution for balance of deep water fish in the near future.
* We’ve adjusted gold distribution in 1v1s to be spawned more evenly between players
* Fixed a spawn issue where players could spawn on the wrong side of the bay on larger team games

###Danube River
* Large gold deposits have been rebalanced to more reliably spawn evenly between teams
* We’ve changed the central crossing to be a Stone Bridge. We're able to add bridges to maps, and the central stone bridge was added to Danube River to help break up naval dominance. Players who seek control of the water will need to now build ships on both their half of the river as well as their opponent’s half.
* Fixed an issue where in larger games, teammates could spawn on the wrong side of the river.

###Mountain Pass
* Sacred Sites have been given a buffer of flat terrain to ensure they spawn correctly.
* Resources in 1v1 Micro size maps have been balanced to more equally spawn resources on each side of the mountain range. Previously, there was an odd number of gold and stone deposits spawning, which could lead to unbalanced resource generation between players.
* An additional small gold and stone have been added for ensuring that we can generate maps with fair distribution.
* An indexing error in the map script was fixed that was leading to the mountain range giving one player slightly more area on their side of the map. Now, the total area of the map should be split much more evenly between the sides of the mountains.

###Confluence
* We’ve updated gold spawns to be more fairly distributed for players in 1v1.
* Adjusted the crossings on this map. Now, a ford will spawn on each arm of the river near the edge of the map, and near the center confluence point, a stone bridge will spawn on each arm of the river. This should help reduce water supremacy and make moving land armies through the map much smoother.
* Rivers in Confluence have also been straightened out in order to make the center of the map more consistent and predictable. The Sacred Sites will be placed around the confluence of the river, one in each quadrant, near the bridge crossings. We found the previous version of the map, when Sacred Sites could be placed anywhere along the rivers in each quadrant, felt unfocused and could lead to a more scattered map flow. This change, along with the inclusion of the bridges themselves, will hopefully give the map a tighter flow and limit the dominance of powerful warships that previously could have full control of the map.

###Ancient Spires
* Removed errant deep water fish that would spawn on Micro (1v1) size matches
* We’ve adjusted trade post spawns to ensure that they do not spawn on isolated islands created by lakes at the side of the map. This should help ensure that both trade posts are available for players to trade with.

###Altai
* We’ve fixed rare instances of Sacred Sites not spawning. This was occasionally caused by a random mountain spawning beside the tile that was designated to spawn a Sacred Site, and as we give Sacred Sites a mountain buffer around their spawn area, it could leave no room for the site to spawn.
* We’ve fixed rare cases of players spawning too close to the side mountain ranges and stomping out things like Sacred Sites and Trade Posts

###Mongolian Heights
* Number of relics increased to 4 base + 1 per player, up from 3 base + 1 per player, in order to distribute them evenly across the river
* Number of contested resources all adjusted to be spawning in an even amount, in order to ensure that both sides of the river receive an equal share of resources
* Fixed an indexing error in the map script that was resulting in the river giving one side of the map a bit more playable space than the other. The river should now perfectly split the playable sides in half.
* Space between sheep herds was increased to cut down on the instances of 5+ sheep spawning together
* Adjusted the spawning of the cliffs to ensure that each player is given a flat path from their start position to the river. Previously, some players could receive a map generation where their starting area was protected by a long cliff, while the opponent was in a much more open area. This should help in evening up the geography.

###Hill and Dale
* We’ve tuned down wolf spawns from 2 per Sacred Site to 1 per Sacred Site.
* We’ve tuned starting forests to not be able to close off a full ramp to the player’s plateau. Players will now get one regular forest and one smaller forest on their plateau
* Overhauled how the plateaus spawn to provide a more consistent experience. Plateau sizes will now be the same for both players, and team plateau sizes can no longer sometimes be very disproportional. 
* The main plateau entry ramp had its size slightly increased.

###King of the Hill
We've done an overhaul to the King of the Hill map to ensure that generations are more even and consistent. We saw previously that some players could have very little wood near their TC, or that their path to the top of the hill was much longer or more difficult than their opponents. We also saw many instances of the gold and stone being distributed on the hill unfairly. We've taken out a bunch of the more unfair aspects of the randomness of these parameters. On new generations, you should now see:

* Overhauled hill generation to ensure fairness between players. Pathways up the hill are now based directly on player spawn locations, with players getting a straight shot access to the top of the hill. Large gold and stone locations are mirrored on the hill to provide equal access to contested resources.
* Removed all random forests on the map.
* A dense perimeter forest was added that rings the entire map. The goal of forests on KotH was always to need to balance fighting for central gold and stone with the necessity of maintaining a presence on the outer parts of the map for wood and food, but we were seeing many instances where wood access between players could be incredibly unbalanced. This change should ensure that all players have access to ample wood on the map edges.

________________________________________

##Added Maps
###MegaRandom
As the name implies, MegaRandom has the ability to spawn in an enormous number of different configurations. We’ve created a huge number of random parameters that MegaRandom can choose from when generating, such as whether to spawn lakes and rivers, which types of impasse to use to generate terrain (if any), whether to spawn extra amounts of some resources, whether to incorporate special terrain patterns, and much more!

* Send us your best MegaRandom generations! We will continue to update MegaRandom over time to keep it fresh and exciting, and to add potentially even more wackiness!

###Crafted Map “Valley Battle”

My theory for 28 Years Later,34,28dayslater,https://i.redd.it/wm6dgr3ol47e1.png,1734317943.0,"So I've attached a rough estimate map of what my take is on the world of 28 Years Later. I couldn't shade the Mediterranean islands in green as I used a basic site, but they'd be green not red. 

I count 28 weeks as canon and hope the new trilogy will too. I'd also love to see Imogen Poots character (Tammy) return from that film. They could instead bring back Mackintosh Muggleton (Andy) but it seems he quit acting after 28 weeks later and only returned to acting the past year now an adult, so maybe he wouldn't be up for it. Either way I'd like to see either of the return as a legacy character in the new trilogy at some point to show what really happened on that helicopter when it got to France.

My map shows what I would expect may have been the outcome if they keep it canon France seen an outbreak. 

In my head, the virus spread and the pilot turns. Andy infecting him somehow. Tammy avoids infection and flees when it crashes but either gets separated from Andy or he dies. Him dying makes sense though as he's an potential cure and losing him sets back the chance of that for a long time.

So the pilot infects a village. Tammy escapes off into France. The infection spread all across France in 2 weeks. The French and the rest of the EU had spent the past 6 months after Britain fell, heavily investing in weapons and military to contain any future outbreak as did the US and Russia etc. 

But no one counted on a new variant. One where the infected aren't all just mindless angry rabid animals. 1 in about 40 take on the infection symptoms Don had. This new variant came from a carrier who was immune infecting someone. So it mutated. Certain people with certain genetic traits become infected and symptomatic but retain some high functioning intelligence. Similar to that seen in dogs etc. They have basic memories, can problem solve when needed and often choose to hunt or stall rather than just attack. They can open doors etc. 

Because of this new variant, the infected prove harder to keep back as smarter infected hide and sneak around military. They break past lines of defense this way and spread the infection just one or two getting past at a time whilst thousands of mindless infected are focused on by military. 

After 6 months, most of continental Europe has fallen. Lines of defense are pulled back to the Nordics/Scandinavia and Eastern Europe. NATO protects Scandinavia by putting a strong heavy military line at the Danish-German border. This narrow strip of land is patrolled by tens of thousands of soldiers stationed in south Denmark. They construct walls and minefields etc. Scandinavia is saved, but some parts of Denmark are sacrificed to the south to do this and existing infected are there. 

In Eastern Europe NATO and Russia worked together to create a second defense line. This one involved a similar set up but on a grander scale. Massive barriers and walls and hundreds of thousands of active personel there at all times along the line stretching from north Central Europe to south eastern Europe. 

Countries along the line still see infected breach from time to time and aren't considered totally safe but mostly, infected struggle to penetrative more than a few dozen kms past the line before being picked off by soldiers or snipers or airforce etc. Many of the people who lived in countries along the line have chosen to leave and resettled in Scandinavia or Russia etc. 

Ireland is the only remaining major west European nation. It was spared from all infection thanks to its separation from Britain and Continental Europe by sea. The UK government has since handed Northern Ireland back to Ireland as the UK is now considered a dead country. After 3 decades, it's widely accepted Britain is never coming back again. Northern Ireland the rump state of the UK is part of Ireland. 

Ireland and Scandinavia work with Mediterranean island nations like Malta, Cyprus and the French Corsica, Italian Sardinia and Scicily and Greek Islands, the rump states of those former states, to control and preserve what is left of Europe. 

The USA, Canada and Australia etc work with these countries also via an expanded NATO to help. Russia now has rebuilt a USSR style empire due to its influence in Eastern Europe and largely prevents infection spreading in Eastern Europe.

7 or 8 months into the French outbreak, the infection spread into Asia via Turkeys and the Caucasus nations. This allowed the virus to spread into Africa and Mainland Asia. 

The impoverished nations of Africa and the Middle East fell very fast and due to the disaster happening in Europe and the attempt to save the remaining European nations and fortify their defenses, help came late to most of the African and middle Eastern States. 

Russia managed to help prevent it spreading into their southern territories by helping states to the south and using them as buffers. Though they are not to this day considered truly safe and experience regular small outbreaks which Russia manages with extreme force and bombing. 

The virus was prevented from flooding Southern Africa, thanks largely to the South African military who had a year to prepare almost and seen how other nations failed on the continent. As the infection hit the far south of Africa later, western and Russian help did arrive here as Europe was largely secured by then. 

In Asia, the virus swept across the south of the continent like wildfire. Spreading faster here once it arrived than anywhere else before. The massive population of 2+ billion and poor infrastructure, allowed infection to spread fast with no way to evacuate so many. 

China sacrificed it's western provinces to save its east which is now secure but there are some pockets of infection now and again that break past their main barriers and line or defense but as in Europe they get caught quick and never get too far beyond the infection zones.

The Korean Peninsula is in a similar situation to China, having had the benefit of China acting a strong buffer that limited infection into Korea.

All Asian island nations are intact, with Japan the main power in that region and working with China to contain and prevent spread. 

Things have been largely calm the past 20 years. Infection pockets appearing in orange regions every month or two ranging in the dozens or hundreds of people but they are quickly wiped out. 

Inside the red zones millions of infected live. The new variants eating and drinking and remembering to protect themselves. The mindless original type infected don't attack the higher functioning infected and instead have developed pack like structures. With the high functioning variants a type of alpha and the low functioning betas who follow the alphas and so live much longer under their leadership. Animals but not totally mindless creatures like in 28 days.

This go south in the 28th year when a new variant again emerges in Eastern Europe which becomes harder to control. It starts to grow impossible to keep the infected back and global fears rise as it becomes clear a third global outbreak might be coming. One that may threaten all nations, even island nations and the Americas. 

In response NATO send in troops and scientists to Britain to get samples of blood from British infected closely linked to the original outbreak and to try create a vaccine. The policy for years has been Britain and other totally ""red"" nations aren't to be visited and are in full quarantine despite the fact the green and orange nations know there are hundreds of thousands of survivors spread across the red countries in small communities, clinging to life and forming semi functional agricultural societies. Contact with them before this was limited visiting totally banned as the last time attempt was made to clean up or aid in rebuilding a red nation, London fell for a second time and France was infected. 

These troops, a mix of Scandinavian, Irish and American soldiers make contact with a settlement in Northern England and are hesitantly provided with help in obtaining infected they require, needing the surviving British help due to their knowledge of how the infected in Britain operate today.

The troops and scientists are surprised and shocked when they see that the infected deep in red territory are far more organised and insidious than initially feared and a massive challenge exists in accomplishing their mission. But if they fail, they risk the entire world being infected in a 3rd outbreak that will push humanity to the point of near extinction. They also are shocked when they make contact with Ralph Fiennes character, a doctor and research scientist who worked in the Cambridge lab, now in his 60s, alive after all these years. He is recognised as a head member of the team that developed the initial rage virus which they were studying in chimps. His survival becomes high profile as he may be instrumental in creating a vaccine and it becomes top priority his is located and transported to a green zone. 

In the decades since 2002, he has slowly deteriorated mentally, filled with guilt and anguish for his part in the apocalypse and deaths of nearly 2 billion people. His research was done with good intentions for mankind and he is deeply regretful, having hidden his full identity for 28 years, only identifying as a regular doctor. 

The arrival of NATO for the first time since the second outbreak and their discovery of him causes him massive stress and he becomes unpredictable.

My guess on the basic direction of the film and world 28 years takes place in.","['my one caveat with this is I think its unrealistic for the virus to spread south of the sahara desert. also if weeks is still being considered its clear that the US had a pretty brutal contingency plan for another outbreak. I imagine that if it spread into france they would go even harder. carpet bombing, probably use of nerve gases and even nuclear weapons would be used to sterilize any infected zones', 'i personally like to think the infection didnt spread too far. the reason why britain was fubar was because of:\n\n1: their small army\n\n2: the novelty of the rage virus, nobody knew wtf was happening.\n\nby 28 WL, the novelty wouldve worn off and the UN/NATO wouldve likely researched mostly everything about the rage virus, so when it gets to europe its stopped since its fighting larger armies that know basically everything about it.\n\ninteresting theory though. i like it', 'Remember that it only takes one drop of blood or fluid to infect an entire country. If we get realistic, remember how the supposed powers reacted to covid 1 or 2 months after the first outbreak, there are thousands of possibilities that the infection travels to other continents.

AMOC Collapse: What changes will it bring?,269,collapse,https://www.reddit.com/r/collapse/comments/1anxxwz/amoc_collapse_what_changes_will_it_bring/,1707620691.0,"I've been trying to pieces together the system puzzle of how a changing climate will affect literally everything for the better part of a year now and one of the questions I've had regarding one of the tipping points, the potential collapse of the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC), is how will that affect the larger climate system? Yesterday, we got some specific answers. The study for which I'm sure you've seen the headlines (and you can find here: [https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/sciadv.adk1189](https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/sciadv.adk1189)), has some interesting tidbits in it that helped me gain a better understanding and that I thought I'd share. 

For those who don't know, the AMOC carries water from the Caribbean and and mid-Atlantic up the east coast of the US then across the north Atlantic bringing warm waters, and subsequently warmer temperatures to western Europe, notably France, the British Isles, Iceland and Scandinavia. The warm water then meets the cold waters and atmosphere of the Arctic where the water becomes more dense as it cools. Ice forms on the surface causing greater increases in density at the surface for the water that doesn't freeze, which causes the denser water to sink forming a downward current. As the atmosphere warms, the water doesn't cool off as quickly or to as great an extent meaning the downward velocity of water slows. This becomes a feedback loop which warms the lower atmosphere. More heat also causes more melting of the Greenland ice sheet. The freshwater flows into the ocean decreasing the salinity of the surface water. Since what causes the surface water to sink is the increased density of the surface compared to the lower levels of water, causing the water to be less dense to begin with increase the amount of salinity accumulation that needs to happen to induce a downward velocity. Over time, the entire current slows and weakens and eventually stops its overturning movement in the north Atlantic.

Several things happen if the AMOC is no longer overturning according to the study:

1. Slow down in the current leads to increased warming between the equator and 30 degrees North (roughly the latitude of New Orleans for reference).
2. The greater heat increases the strength of the subtropical jet stream north of the equator which slows down heat transfer from the southern latitudes to latitudes above 30N. This also increases the strength of the Hadley Cell in this region which means a strengthening of the wind currents from northeast to southwest. (More background info: [https://www.noaa.gov/jetstream/global/jet-stream#:\~:text=The%20polar%20jet%20is%20located,%2F%20442%20km%2Fh](https://www.noaa.gov/jetstream/global/jet-stream#:~:text=The%20polar%20jet%20is%20located,%2F%20442%20km%2Fh)).)  
3. This leads to a a southerly deflection of the Inter-Tropical Convergence Zone, ITCZ, which changes rainfall patterns for regions along the equator. The most drastic of which will be in the Amazon where the dry and rainy season will switch times of year due to changes in the ITCZ. Whether this deflection is localized to areas around equatorial South America or is a global southerly deflection is not discussed. If it's global, this might also cause rainfall changes in places like west Africa and Malaysia/Indonesia. (More background info: [https://www.noaa.gov/jetstream/tropical/convergence-zone](https://www.noaa.gov/jetstream/tropical/convergence-zone))
4. If easterly trade winds across north Africa are strengthened, it would likely lead to an increased movement of Saharan dust into the atmosphere and more upwelling along the west African coast bringing more minerals to the ocean for seeding phytoplankton and sargassum blooms. This would be good for marine biodiversity off the west African coast, but with warmer, more saline, and acidic waters it might be a wash. 
5. Changes in rainfall patterns in the Amazon, changes in what time of year will reach a temperature extreme, and an overall reduction in rainfall, will exacerbate biodiversity loss and along with an overall reduction in precipitation will see the rainforest transition faster into savanna. 
6. A slower current leads to increased sea level rise due to piling from ocean currents and thermal expansion of water in the Gulf of Mexico and around the US East Coast which will cause greater flooding in these areas. 
7. Warm water is substantially reduced to practically nothing when flowing into the north Atlantic leading to cooler temperatures in northern latitudes and greater ocean stratification. The ocean stratification leads to a loss of dissolved oxygen into the deep waters of the north Atlantic which reduces plankton and affects the entire marine ecosystem in the north Atlantic.  
8. The cooler north Atlantic will see a drastic increase in seasonal sea ice. The study says that it could extend as far down as 50 degrees north which is about the southern most tip of England. Essentially, at some point you could travel across the sea ice from Ireland to Canada. This has a positive feedback effect on cooling due to the ice-albedo effect leading to greater cooling. It should be noted that the study shows a cooling effect at latitudes higher than 50N even in the Pacific, but it is far less pronounced in Siberia and Canada, and the western coast of Canada and Southeast Alaska don't show a temperature reduction. 
9. The cooler waters in the north Atlantic will lead to a fall in sea level along western and northern Europe. This will be due to a reduction in the thermal expansion as well as volume transport into these areas.
10. The reduced temperatures in northern latitudes will slow and potentially reverse ice sheet loss in Greenland, but it will also cause a drastic reduction in temperatures across northern and western Europe, particularly in places like England, Iceland, and Scandinavia countries, but also as far south as Spain. While Madrid might see a temperature reduction of 2-3C, Bergen, Norway would see a fall of close to 13-15C. 
11. The reduced heat in the northern Atlantic will lead to reduced evaporation and consequently a drier Europe. This will affect agriculture for certain, but I'm unsure what this would mean for wildfires in the region. While there will be less precipitation, less heat means less evaporation of soil moisture and surface water. That doesn't mean there will be more fresh water available. Agricultural irrigation could still lead to continued declines in available freshwater. At the very least, I would expect a slowdown if not a reversal in the decline of alpine glaciers in central Europe due to a temperature reduction. This will have secondary affects which would likely include interruptions of trade on waterways for the region. 
12. Because the energy balance of the Earth hasn't changed, a major current that helped take warm heat into the deep ocean stops, and an increased subtropical jet stream slows atmospheric heat exchange along the boundary, the southern hemisphere will be warmer as a whole which will also lead to increased loss of Antarctic  ice sheets.
13. I'm currently unsure how an AMOC collapse will affect ENSO variability, but one study did find that there may be a reduced variability in extreme El Nino events. ([https://journals.ametsoc.org/view/journals/clim/35/16/JCLI-D-21-0293.1.xml](https://journals.ametsoc.org/view/journals/clim/35/16/JCLI-D-21-0293.1.xml)).
14. I don't know what this means for cyclone formation in the Caribbean and mid-Atlantic. While the waters will be warmer, the increased strength of the trade winds might cause more dust to be brought in from the Sahara disrupting formation. Weaker El Nino events might lead to less shear winds allowing more cyclone formation, but that's if an AMOC collapse leads to weaker El Nino events. I also don't know if it's been studied how a more southerly ITCZ and a stronger Hadley Cell movement would affect both Atlantic and Pacific cyclone formation and rainfall. The study noted that Australia would see greater levels of precipitation and it notes Southeast Asia as a region, but it doesn't define what constitutes that region. 
15. I'm also unsure what a colder north Atlantic will mean for the polar jet stream. I would suspect that cooler temperatures in those latitudes would lead to a reduced temperature gradient and reduce the polar jet stream causing more polar vortexes, but it might also lead to an even greater cooling at the polar latitudes leading to an increased gradient and therefore a stronger polar jet stream and subsequently less polar vortexes. More polar vortexes mean more climate variability, while less mean more climate stability in the temperate latitudes. I haven't found anything to give an indication one way or another. 

Those are the at least some of the systemic changes, but how it relates to societal collapse depends greatly on when this occurs, what happens between then and the start of the AMOC's decline, and exactly how long it takes for the AMOC to collapse. The most recent model showed a rapid decline over a period of a 100 years, rapid being relative. The thing is about this 100 year collapse in the model  is that they started ""from a statistical equilibrium solution of a preindustrial control simulation and \[kept\] greenhouse gas and solar and aerosol forcings constant to preindustrial levels during the simulation,"" which means their model only took into account freshwater forcings on the AMOC. This means that even if the model was perfect (which of course it's not) it still doesn't take into account density changes in sea surface water due to heat. So it is feasible that it could happen more quickly than the model predicts. 

It was reported this summer that a collapse of the AMOC was likely to happen sometime this century and could be as early as next year, but it was more likely to occur by mid-century ([https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-023-39810-w](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-023-39810-w)). If that's the case, this could be happening at a time when temperatures are already 3-4C warmer. If this were to happen over a period of 30 years rather than 100, even with increased warming over this time period (assuming climate emissions continue past 2050), Europe would have a climate more like today than a new ice age. While some areas like Iceland and Norway will be much colder than they are now, the overall temperature change would balance out with the heating, at least in western and northern Europe.

But that may not be the case. The cooling is caused not only by a loss of heat transport, but also the ice-albedo effect through the regrowth of sea ice. If the world is 3C warmer, sea ice might well be seasonal at that point. While a loss of heat transport by warm ocean surface water will have a sizeable cooling effect, it may not have enough of one to create the positive feedbacks of building more ice. It's possible that the atmosphere will have warmed to the point where even the disruption and outright collapse of the AMOC won't create as significant an impact as is being described in the recently published model. There would be some degree of cooling in northern latitudes, but the bulk of the effects of an AMOC collapse would be lessened by a world that's already warmed too much too quickly. If it were to start collapsing next year and did so in a period of two decades, we would likely feel the full effects. But if it were to start collapsing 30 years from now and we'd already experienced 10 years of ice-free polar summers at that point, I'm not sure how much of a difference it would actually make. ","['Thank you for putting together this summary. I found it really helpful (if scary).', 'A fantastic compilation of known trends and effects; thank you for posting.

Has anyone been a victim of red diesel fraud in Britain?,47,CarTalkUK,https://www.reddit.com/r/CarTalkUK/comments/1dzg4gq/has_anyone_been_a_victim_of_red_diesel_fraud_in/,1720565616.0,"Red diesel fraud is widespread in Ireland but you never seem to hear about it over here. Has anyone ever encountered it or heard about it?

In case you're wondering what I'm on about, red diesel is diesel with a red dye added to it which is sold for agricultural use with lower fuel taxes. It is substantially cheaper than regular 'retail' diesel. Red diesel fraud works like this: gangs buy red diesel from shady or desperate farmers (or steal it) and add chemicals to it to remove the red dye, making it look like regular diesel to the naked eye. They then sell this diesel to independent filling stations on the cheap, allowing the stations to make an enormous margin selling it to drivers at the usual price. People fill their cars at the pumps and drive off as normal. But, unlike the red dye itself, the chemicals used to remove the red dye wreak havoc on engines over time and will eventually ruin your car, especially if you fill it with this 'un-redded' diesel multiple times. The problem is that this takes time to occur, making it nigh-on impossible to work out which station sold you the dodgy diesel perhaps weeks or months ago which has now destroyed your engine. Even if you know you've only ever filled up at one independent filling station, that station can always maintain plausible deniability due to the long lag between filling up and your car's demise.

This has happened to multiple relatives of mine in Ireland. They are pretty sure they know which filling station is the culprit but it's impossible to prove it. The issue is common enough over there that many rural people go out of their way to avoid independent and small-brand filling stations and only fill up at major chains. I've never heard of it happening in Britain though - has anyone had any experience?

EDIT: commentors more knowledgeable than me have explained in more detail below how the diesel 'washing' is done and how this can damage a car. I have no idea how this process works - I've only seen the outcomes of it.","['In large scale operations, the process of ""washing"" diesel usually involves stacks of IBC tanks, red/green diesel in the top tank, cat litter in the middle & clean colour diesel comes out in the bottom.\n\nThe problem with the cat litter is that it not only removes the dye but it also removes the lubricity from the diesel. Which in turn can damage high pressure fuel pumps & injectors especially on modern diesels.\n\nIf you ever think you have washed diesel, put 100ml of 2 stroke oil in your tank with the fuel, that will restore the lubricity of the fuel. \n\n\nYears ago, lots of diesel cars just ran on kerosene & a drop of 2 stroke oil added to the tank. 1/3 the price of road diesel.', 'They still sell red diesel at the pump in my local petrol station.\n\nA few years ago i had a falling out with a neighbour who was running red diesel, she reported me for using red and I was pulled on the M27 and had my tank dipped. Came back clear, I’ve never ran red diesel, i’d end up overthinking it and stressing myself out.', '[deleted]']",0.03508676351896691,0.3842311831294883,1
Undertones singer takes aim at DUP’s Poots over Lough Neagh algae crisis,136,northernireland,https://www.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/news/environment/undertones-singer-takes-aim-at-dups-poots-over-lough-neagh-algae-crisis/a1029763311.html,1695382867.0,"Undertones singer takes aim at DUP’s Poots over Lough Neagh algae crisis
The Derry man has been vocal on environmental issues throughout the UK in recent years


Former DUP Agriculture minister Edwin Poots is behind a decision allowing farmers to flout pollution laws, ex-Undertones frontman Feargal Sharkey has said.
Mr Sharkey – who has in recent years campaigned for safer waterways throughout the UK – weighed in on the crisis currently affecting Lough Neagh by posting on X (formerly Twitter) on Thursday morning.

The lough has been engulfed this year by cyanobacteria, known as blue-green algae. The algae can be toxic.

The situation has caused outrage, as Lough Neagh provides 40% of our drinking water.

Increased growth this year has been attributed to a “perfect storm” of warm, wet weather and increased nutrients in the water caused by various forms of pollution.

Mr Sharkey said a decision taken by Mr Poots last year had contributed to the largest freshwater lake in the UK and Ireland becoming “the largest cesspit in Europe”.

Lough Neagh and two of its tributaries see spike in pollution levels since 2021
Sharing a screenshot of a decision taken by the former DAERA minister in October 2022, Mr Sharkey highlighted a quote from Mr Poots revealing penalties for farmers who repeatedly broke the rules would be capped at 15% of government payments.

Farmers are required to keep their land in good agricultural and environmental condition (GAEC) in order to qualify for full payments under a number of government schemes.

But they can have their payments reduced for intentional or negligent breaches, with previous rules allowing deductions of up to 100%.

However, legislation that came into effect in 2022 reduced this threshold significantly.

""Under the (EU) existing arrangements, certain repeated negligent breaches can be considered intentional, attracting very high financial penalties,” Mr Poots said at the time..


""The new regime means that these repeated negligent penalties will be capped at 15%. This is a much fairer approach to our hard-working farmers.

""This is only possible because we have left the European Union and can now make decisions to suit local needs.”

Mr Sharkey said Mr Poots was “the man who changed the rules so that famers who repeatedly and negligently break pollution laws can have their fines capped at 15% of previous levels”.

It comes after DAERA figures revealed that Lough Neagh and two of its waterways have recorded the largest number of medium to high level pollution incidents over the last two years.

The data revealed 84 of the 268 high and medium level pollution incidents recorded in Northern Ireland between January 2021 and August 2023 occurred in the River Blackwater (33), Lough Neagh (30) and Lower Bann (21).

Since 2021, some 2,006 pollution incidents of all levels have been recorded across our waterways, according to the Department for Agriculture, Environment and Rural Affairs (DAERA).

Both Edwin Poots and the DUP have been approached for comment.","['Edwin Poots.

## SUMMARY

Another new week, and we're edging closer to more deadlines for the upcoming election. This Thursday is the deadline for registering for a postal or proxy vote **if you're in Northern Ireland**, while next Tuesday is the deadline for everyone to register to vote in time (if you're already registered, you don't have to register again).

Over the weekend, **Labour** held their ""Clause V"" meeting which finalises their manifesto pledges. The manifesto [is expected](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/election-2019-50441707) to be formally unveiled. It is set to include previously announced policies such as free broadband for all, abolishing tuition fees, and bringing utilities such as rail and water under public ownership. 

It is currently unknown when other parties are expected to launch their manifestos, but it could be as early as later this week.

Also over the weekend, **Labour** [announced](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/election-2019-50448108) free dental check-ups on the NHS by scrapping ""band one"" dental charges (currently £22.70). 

The **Conservatives** [promised](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/election-2019-50449039) an ""equal"" immigration system after Brexit - however, they ruled out setting an ""arbitrary"" immigration target.

The **Scottish National Party** [has called for](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/election-2019-50452273) TV licence decisions to be made independently of government to avoid political ""game-playing"". **Brendan O'Hara** (former SNP spokesman for Culture and Media) accused the Conservative UK government of having ""taken older people for granted for too long"".

**Corbyn** [revealed plans](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2PIm7Bdfyo) for a new ""climate apprenticeship program"", where 320,000 apprentices would be trained in jobs such as construction, manufacturing and design within renewable energy, transport, sustainable agriculture and forestry, during Labour's first term in office.

**Swinson** [unveiled a plan](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hJXx0RiLFks) to replace business rates with a new ""commercial landowner levy"". She called the Liberal Democrats the ""natural party of business"" because they would cancel Brexit.

Also yesterday, [following a documentary](https://www.itv.com/hub/exposure-when-boris-met-jennifer/2a7979a0001) about her relationship with Boris Johnson broadcast on ITV on Sunday night, **Jennifer Arcuri** [made more headlines](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-50458461) after appearing on several morning TV shows. Speaking to Victoria Derbyshire, she said ""I am very upset that he could not man up and pick up the phone and call me"" after he refused to answer her phone call last week. Arcuri's relationship with Johnson is at the centre of a [misconduct controversy](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-50450167) after reports that she received favourable treatment while Johnson was Mayor of London.

"""This is in 1930. I wasn't born. Most of us weren't. It predates us legislatively..."". Minister Bronwyn Eyre on Indigenous critiques of Saskatchewan's 'exclusive jurisdiction' over natural resources and Indigenous Rights violations via the Sask First Act.",130,saskatchewan,https://www.reddit.com/r/saskatchewan/comments/121y33z/this_is_in_1930_i_wasnt_born_most_of_us_werent_it/,1679776103.0,"I've noticed a number of people on Reddit asking how the Sask First Act violates Treaty or Inherent rights. Many commenters also state that Indigenous organizations are claiming the Sask First Act violates Treaty and Inherent rights without explanation. How the Sask First Act-- and Saskatchewan's existing approach to managing natural resources-- violates Indigenous rights is clearly laid out in letters read by the NDP at the Intergovernmental and Affairs Committee on March 15th (available [here](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=&cad=rja&uact=8&ved=2ahUKEwj5z5S38vf9AhVRIjQIHdQNBx8QFnoECAkQAQ&url=https%3A%2F%2Fdocs.legassembly.sk.ca%2Flegdocs%2FLegislative%2520Committees%2FIAJ%2FDebates%2F20230315Debates-IAJ.pdf&usg=AOvVaw1_GCO6ih985AEzLHHK7MDy) thx to u/Thee_Randy_Lahey for posting the link).

Many of the critiques presented by Indigenous Nations relate to the process and interpretation of Saskatchewan's jurisdictional claim over natural resources through the Natural Resource Transfer Act of 1930. From the letter submitted by Piapot First Nation to the Province, Jan 27 2023:

&#x200B;

>The Piapot First Nation declares that **the Government of Saskatchewan does not have the legal authority to assert exclusive jurisdiction** over the natural resources within the province. **In 1930 the federal Crown unilaterally transferred the administration and control over the lands and natural resources to the provinces** of Manitoba, Saskatchewan, and Alberta pursuant to the natural resources transfer Act, 1930 via the Constitution Act. F**irst Nations have always maintained that this transfer was unlawful and it was done without the consent of, nor even consultation with, the First Nations.**  
>  
>Further, First Nations have always maintained that we did not relinquish, cede, or surrender rights to the natural resources at the time of treaty negotiations. Rather we agreed to open up the land for settlement, sharing six inches into the ground, or plow depth, for agricultural purposes.  
>  
>The Saskatchewan First Act completely ignores my First Nation’s inherent treaty and constitutional rights to the lands, resources, and waters in this province....  
>  
>**Much of Canada’s economy has been built from the extraction of natural resources from our territories. Your government shares revenues from the natural resources with the provinces and municipalities, but none of the benefits come to the First Nations.** Resource revenue sharing with First Nations must be implemented to ensure adherence to the treaties.

&#x200B;

Similarly, in their letter, Onion Lake Cree Nation explain:

&#x200B;

>We write/speak on behalf of the leadership and members of Onion Lake Cree Nation. We are a sovereign Nation that made Treaty 6 with the Imperial Crown, Britain and Ireland, in 1876 at Fort Pitt. Our Nation’s lands now cross the boundary between the provinces of Alberta and Saskatchewan. Treaty 6 lands have sustained our ancestors for generations, and they continue to sustain our people.  
>  
>We have read Bill 88 and wish to make clear our opposition to **The Saskatchewan First Act. Unfortunately the plain words of Bill 88 reference and repeat the failures of the Crown to honour and walk the path of treaty, failures both recent and from nearly a century ago. The preamble to the bill references the Natural Resources Transfer Agreement, 1930 as granting Saskatchewan full status within Confederation with autonomy over its Crown lands and natural resources.**  
>  
>**We have a much different recollection of the NRTA as an example of the unilateral derogation of our treaty rights to life and livelihood. Our rights to livelihood through harvest of those same natural resources were bargained away by the Dominion government without our consent.** In fact during the same time the federal government amended the Indian Act to prohibit First Nations from hiring lawyers to pursue land claims and to advocate for our rights. **Our rights to the commercial harvest in our traditional territory of our resources were extinguished by the NRTA**  
>  
>**The autonomy that Saskatchewan claims in Bill 88 over its lands and resources came at the expense of our ancestors and our livelihoods. Our ancestors never gave up rights or access to our natural resources during treaty making.** In fact oral histories by elders in our Nation tell us we were . . . only allowed the Crown’s subjects to use our lands to the depth of the plow. We still retain full access, control, and jurisdiction over the natural resources in our territories and in what is now called Saskatchewan.

Similar arguments were presented and proposed by Little Pine First Nation, Moosomin First Nation (""there was also a lot of talk about sovereignty and self-determination in those NRTA negotiations, but certainly not our sovereignty or self-determination""), Ochapowace First Nation (""We have always maintained that this transfer was unlawful and it was done without the consent of, nor even consultation with, our people"").

Including the provision that the Sask First Act will adhere to Section 35 of the Constitution Act 1982 may mean the act is constitutional but does not mean it doesn't violate Treaty or Inherent rights. Rather, SK is stating they are doubling down on an interpretation of the NRTA that is rooted in violation of Indigenous rights.

**Minister of Justice/Attorney General Bronwyn Eyre's response** shows she's aware of Indigenous understandings of the NRTA but conveniently dismisses them with an argument that certainly holds no legal water (it predates this legislature):

&#x200B;

>**On the NRTA, the Natural Resource Transfer Agreement, this is in 1930. I wasn’t born. Most of us weren’t. It predates us legislatively.** And certainly jurisdiction-wise it comes up as, certainly, a topic in a lot of the conversations that I’ve had with Indigenous partners, certainly that the member of Athabasca and other members have had. **It is certainly a key context for the views on what land means, what jurisdiction means, and I understand and respect that position and that opinion in that context, but it certainly predates and is completely outside the realm of this legislature or of I or the government to address.**.. As I said in my opening remarks, the view was that exclusive jurisdiction was explicitly called for to counterbalance federal powers. And there was reason for that, **but it predates us. And now that is the reality. It is in the Constitution.** It is part of the division of powers, and what we are asserting is the meaning and significance of 92A and exclusive jurisdiction for the province of Saskatchewan.

&#x200B;

The Canadian constitution does not supersede Treaty or Inherent rights. Saskatchewan Colonialism 101 continues in the Sask First Act.","['You know, I do understand that not everyone has access to a quality education. \n\nHowever, political parties should have to ensure that their candidates have a basic understanding of Canadian history & legislation that is pertinent to their jurisdiction. \n\nThere are politicians at all levels who seem ignorant of our history & legislation. \n\nSo as not to be classist or ableist, I think the parties should have a chance to educate their candidates & those candidates should have to be able to pass a 100 level Canadian history course’s (with appropriate accommodations for those who require them due to disability) comprehensive final exam in order to actually sit as a member of a legislative body.', 'Guys, the Sask First Act is purely political in nature. It has exactly 0% to do with what is or is not constitutional. The Sask Party\'s entire political platform is built out of ""Trudeau bad"" and ""Ottawa bad"" narrative planks. This BS act exists purely to promote that insane narrative. It\'s just one more way that they feed their hate-filled ignorant base; give the base something other than the SaskParty to focus on and that guarantees that the dummies are too distracted to pay attention to all the ways the Sask Party is screwing them. It\'s the political equivalent of lighting a house on fire and then distracting the homeowners by pointing at the neighbours while shouting ""LOOK AT THEM!""\n\nThis stupid act will ultimately fail in the courts but that will take long enough for the Sask Party to use it as a political football for at least two election cycles. It will cost us millions in legal fees and court costs and lawyers fees but the Sask Party doesn\'t give a fuck about that becasue it\'s our money they\'re wasting, not theirs. The Sask Party MLAs have nothing but contempt for the voters especially seeing as how most of the voters were dumb enough to vote for them.\n\nDid you vote Sask Party last election? Well the Sask Party is thanking you for your vote so much that they are going to waste your tax dollars tilting at legal windmills for the next several years, all while telling you that this is a good idea. That\'s how stupid they think you are.', 'I’ve said it before and I’ll say it again: Bronwyn Eyre’s disdain for treaty education is well noted. Just google her name and treaty education.

"""Stalin paid the clouds not to rain!"" - On Holodomor Denial",545,badhistory,https://www.reddit.com/r/badhistory/comments/76beft/stalin_paid_the_clouds_not_to_rain_on_holodomor/,1507977373.0,"So there's the meme i've seen pushed by Stalinists lately, coming to the effect of ""Capitalists think Stalin paid the clouds not to rain!"" in regards to the Holodomor. As encapsulated by circlejerky threads [like this one](http://np.reddit.com/r/ShitLiberalsSay/comments/75wnje/why_was_there_not_a_nuremberg_for_communism/do9jye8/)

The claim is basically:

1. There was a famine in Ukraine and other areas of the USSR, but it was the result of weather, and not man-made.

2. The claim it was orchestrated deliberately was invented by the Nazis and popularized by them to justify a war with the USSR. This claim has been extended to including the concept of the Holodomor as a tenet of fascism.

Now before I debunk these claims, I'd like to address a couple of other topics. Firstly, while it's agreed that the Holodomor is a democide, it's heavily debated that it was a genocide. Most scholars have adopted the position that it was not a genocide if genocide is defined at attempting to exterminate an ethnic group. While Ukrainians suffered disproportionately, Kazakhs and south Russians suffered as well, and there is little evidence that it was intended as ""punishment"" for Ukraine. Most scholars have adopted the view that it was a deliberate over-requisitioning of grain to export to fund industrialization, and attempts to circumvent the resultant food shortage in Ukraine led to harsher measures by Stalin which did aim to punish. The second debate is over the number of casualties. Many people try to cite that it was over 10 million killed, partly in order to deflect their own culpability in the holocaust and/or try to portray the USSR as worse. The consensus is around 4 million killed.

In regards to claim one, the only scholar who seriously holds this position is Mark Tauger. Who has been dismissed as completely wrong by every other scholar in the field. Put simply, there is no real evidence for the effect of weather on the harvest. While there were dry periods in 1932, it was nothing that abnormal. This is pretty evident from the fact that no where else in Eastern Europe was there a significant food shortage, despite them sharing the exact same climate. Areas of depopulation of 15-20% run right up to the Polish border at that time and then mysteriously stop. In fact, not even Tauger argues that rain was the cause - because Tauger argues that the famine was the result of plant diseases. Of course this falls prey to the same problem as the drought hypothesis, namely, why does the famine stop at the Polish border? 

Ironically the only other explanations for an ""Accidental Holodomor"" would probably be even less acceptable to them, seeing as how they largely blame the chaotic and poorly planned collectivization of agriculture for their problems.

In any case, even assuming that there was a natural component, their explanation still doesn't prevent Stalin from being responsible. Since around 1800, there has been a high enough rate of agricultural production worldwide that any famine since then has effectively been man-made, even assuming an agricultural component. For example, these same people would almost certainly classify capitalist famines as genocide, even though they have mostly had a natural origin. Especially so since the USSR literally rejected outside aid. [By their logic, the British aren't responsible for the Great Irish Famine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Famine_(Ireland)), because after all, the food supply was affected by potato blight. And [the Great Indian Famine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Famine_of_1876%E2%80%9378) must've been completely fine because of the drought that struck that year, despite the resultant export of food away from drought stricken areas. By their logic, if the Holodomor had a natural cause, then Stalin can't be held responsible, and yet by the same logic they would acquit capitalist culpability in those famines because they had natural causes. Somehow I don't think they would be ok with that.

As well, there's the meme that the famine was caused by ""Kulaks deliberately not working and killing their own livestock"". In the first place, Kulak under Stalin just became a term for any farmer that the regime didn't like, it didn't have any real class element to it. In the second place, killing your livestock won't cause a shortage of food that dramatic, especially since the primary source of food was agriculture. Killing livestock only detracts from future sources of food via slaughtering livestock, not somehow decreasing the amount of food currently available (discounting marginal things like dairy products for example).

In regards to claim 2, the fact is that the Nazis weren't even in power until the end of the famine. Even then, the famine was already well reported thanks to journalists like [Malcolm Muggeridge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malcolm_Muggeridge), who was a leftist at the time, and [Gareth Jones](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gareth_Jones_(journalist)). While there was some doubt at the time over what was happening, largely because of Soviet press censorship, it's obvious in hindsight that a famine was actually occurring. Which is a problem because Soviet denial at the time largely focused on denying that a famine was occurring, which makes the later claims that it had natural causes completely nonsensical. If that was the case, then why didn't they bother publicizing the drought or accepting humanitarian aid? Why instead did they outright deny that a famine was occurring at all? It's especially ironic that they throw around accusations of Nazi Propaganda, because the primary source for this claim is a book by Douglas Tottle, which was literally funded by the USSR in the 1980s, and published via their international publishing arm at Progress Publishers, and which was deteremined to have contained material that was not ""available to a private person without Soviet assistance."" You can read the book [here](http://www.garethjones.org/tottlefraud.pdf), if for some reason you want to. But I'm sure the Stalinists account of their own history is completely trustworthy, as opposed to the consensus of literally every other third-party. As well, while it is used by fascist groups today, I think it's pretty telling that I can't really find a single example of Nazi propaganda referencing the Holodomor. It was probably used for that purpose but I think it's telling that if the Nazis allegedly invented the idea that the Holodomor was deliberate that it's not referenced anywhere on the subject; on wikipedia for example the Nazis are nowhere mentioned on the Holodomor page, and nowhere on the Nazi propaganda themes page, it's literally mentioned only on the ""Holodomor genocide question"" page. Googling it results only in the same conspiracy theories about how the Holodomor was manufactured by the Nazis. I literally cannot find a single example specifically talking about the Holodomor. 

Literally the only evidence that I can find in Tottle's book is (1) some photographs published were from a previous famine, and (2) the Nazis invaded the USSR. From what I can tell any propaganda about the famine published by the Nazis would've been published after the invasion when they were trying to suppress Ukrainian dissent. Not that it stopped the Nazis from modeling their own [Hunger Plan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hunger_Plan) on it. In any case, Tottle appears to be making the bizzare claim that William Randolph Hearst, Gareth Jones, and Joseph Goebbels all collaborated on using the Hearst press to promote Nazi propaganda. Such as the Holodomor apparently. Despite their being no evidence of any of this. And you know, the fact Gareth Jones' diaries on the famine have been studied, but apparently they were all faked too, despite no one knowing at the time that anyone would care about his diaries.

As well, there's the matter of the overwhelming evidence uncovered from the USSR's own archives, confirming that exports of grain continued from famine stricken regions. Whatever, totally reasonable because of drought or something. Alternately, the documents were personally faked by Nikita Kruschchev despite them not admitting the famine until the 1980s, just in order to make Stalin look bad.

A Schleicher Germany Guide,212,Kaiserreich,https://www.reddit.com/r/Kaiserreich/comments/1fhz7gn/a_schleicher_germany_guide/,1726473660.0,"Schleicher is the easiest German path, and here is a strategy that I often do for SP. (Welcome any suggestions for improvement)

Edit: update after for a test run.

# 1. National Focus priorities

[Here is an illustration. The strength of Schleicher is that he can focus purely on the military.](https://preview.redd.it/x1enfrawy3pd1.png?width=2532&format=png&auto=webp&s=1420992432a5ad97a1ed0d2252545ae142ce9571)

The first 20 foci are strictly timed and there is little room for adjustment.

1. **Master of the World**
2. **Buying Time with Spies** (the only 35-day focus)
3. **The Second Expidition to China** (You get 25 pp if victorious)
4. **Military Mission to Constantinople** (Ottoman is a great ally if victorious in the Desert War)

>Wait for Schleicher to be appointed the Chancellor

5. **The Man in the High Castle**

6. **Queverbindung**

7. **Freiwilliger Arbeitsdienst** (In my current version I will always fail BM round 4 if you do not have this focus completed)

8. **Shuffle Prussian Ministries** (ticking war support is superior to 5% civ construction speed)

9. **Sekretariat für Arbeitsbeschaffung**

10. **Secure Mitteleuropa Trade Links**

11. **Expand the Kaiser Wilhelm Society** (1 Research Slot and powerful reform)

>Wait for Black Monday turn to end, note that this timing requires you to win all 5 starting rounds

12. **Regime of the Red General** (You can get partial mob immediately upon completion in 1936/12/2)

13. **Escalate Ruhrkampf Suppression**

>Wait for 1937/1 events to unlock the military tree

14. **Yearning for Cannae** (25% xp malus)

15. **Einkreisungstheorie** (25% xp malus)

16. **Expand the Kriegsschulen** (1 Research Slot)

17. **Establish the W-System** (The most useful 28-day focus)

18. **Leading the Flock** (should be just in time before the first Mitteleuropa Agenda is decided)

>Wait 6 days until the Regulation System Agenda is passed.

19. **The Regulation System**

20. **Centralise Headquarters in Berlin** (You will get 5% of members' civ, which means immediately getting around 15 civs, which increases over time to around 30 by 1939)

That will conclude the 20 early-game focuses. you have much more freedom after 1937/7. In the next phase I like to focus on a balanced tank-air tech rush. The research phase goes like this:

21. **Develop Self Propelled Artillery** (bonus for 1940 Artillery, be sure to have 1939 artillery researched before completion)

22. **Commission Manoeuvre Warfare Textbook** (get Beck appointed theorist. If you are going mobile warfare this is great)

23. **Proliferate Modern Communications** (bonus for 1939 & 1940 radar, be sure to have 1938 radar researched before completion)

24. **Establish the National Unity Front** (The last time it could be done before the Bavarian Nullification crisis.)

25. **Shattering Swords** (or **Operational Air War**)

26. **Dominates the Skies** (or **Supports the Armoured Spearhead**, you want the bonus for 1940 Small Air Frame. You should already be researching 1940 Engine III for about 100 days before picking this focus so that research progress can be synchronised)

27. **Raketenwerfer** (bonus for 1941 Artillery)

28. **Panzer Divisions**

29. **Develop Mechanised Infantry** (bonus 1940 mechanised)

This would conclude all the research bonuses that we'll need. The time is 1938/7/6 and we will be on track to obtain 1940 Planes and Mediums with Howizer II and Radio III by late 1938 or early 1939.

If you want to rush 1940 medium chassis, you will have to rush Mechanised Wave focus early.

You have much more freedom for the rest of the game, here is a suggestion of what to do in late-stage war preparation:

30. **Revolt of the Totalitarians**

31. **The Call to Total War**

32. **Unrestrianed Warfare** (25% xp malus)

33. **Renew the Rathenauplan** (10% efficiency cap, if you prefer production to more army xp, it can be done before Revolt of the Totalitarians)

34. **Industriewerke Network** (for War Preparedness Act & Research bonus for a 1941 production tech)

35. **Infantry Motorisation** (-10% mechanised cost for 1 year)

36. **Expand the HWA Automotive Section** (-10% armour cost for 1 year)

37. **Reform the HWA Aerial Section** (-5% air cost for 1 year)

38. **Mechanised Wave** (10% armour attack & you can also make your tank-mech divisions without expending much xp)

39. **Organise Cartelisation of the Economy** (or another focus that gives industrial decision to finish War Preparedness Act.)

40. **Military Railways** (for War Preparedness Act)

41. **Wegeneer Doctrine** (lowers unrediness debuff)

42. **The Psychology of the Footsoldier** (HP+10% ≈ losses reduced by 10%)

43. **Nationalist Indoctrination** (attack bonus against major)

44. **Surpass Syndicalist Piercing** (gain 10% armour on tank before the production buff expires, but this is purely optional.)

That is all the focuses you can do before 1940. You can do some additional foci to further improve your army, but most of the WK2 should starts in early 1940.

# 2. Poland

**Always be selling Polish assets on cooldown.** You wouldn't be able to sell after the 1938 Polish election, and one round will provide you with 37.5 pp in total, and you have enough influence to go for 4-5 rounds, **that's 150-187.5 pp in total**. That's a significant sum in the early game.

There's an event to choose between losing 10% influence and -15 pp, always choose the second option as 10% influence is worth almost triple the pp.

You don't have to spend any pp on your Oststaaten, you can always send in your tank to make sure it remain loyal.

# 3. Advisors/Policy priorities

>free Batocki-Friebe via focus Shuffle Prussian Ministries

* **Early Mob**
* **Hugenberg** (or Groener for 10% war support advisor, they will both die later)
* **Partial mob**

>free agricultural advisor via event, remember to do the full Agricultural Reform at once

* **Krupp** (or **VKL,** ideally you want to go Krupp first and switch to VKL in early 1939 but you might not have enough pp to do so.)
* **Chief of Army** (Do not pick Beck if you want to go down mobile warfare)
* **Chief of Airforce**
* **Thyssen** (+15% mil construction speed, replace agri advisor before you begin transition to mil)

>Bavarian Nullification Crisis will take 100 pp in total. After which M-P of Prussia will be removed. Hugenberg will die around the same time.

* **Lutz** (-10% armour cost)
* **Zehrer** (or other advisor of your choice, eg. Planck to help with research)

>free theorist (Beck) via focus, you can replace him if you don't want to go down mobile warfare.

* **Chief of Navy**
* **Limited Conscription**
* **Extensive Conscription**
* 3x **High Commands**

# 4. Mitteleuropa

1937/1 - **Directorate** (doubles the effect of subsequent agendas)

1937/7 - **Arms Expert** (-10% Infantry equipment, artillery and armour costs)

1938/1 - **Industrial Advisors** (10% Construction Speed, 10 Factory Output)

1938/7 - **Arms Expert**

1939/1 - **Industrial Advisors**

1939/7 - **Arms Expert**

# 5. Ruhrkampf

You want to keep the intensity between 25 and 75. Don't do the decision to decrease the intensity until after you have passed the Enabling Act , as you can always choose events will lower it for you.

**You want the mission to send an army** (eg. Schleicher assasination attempt after visiting Ruhr) as it will grant you stability.

# 6. Bavarian Nullification Crisis

1. Trust Roedern, do not run for M-P of Prussia
2. let Winnig be vice-chancellor
3. Completed the National Unity Front before 1938
4. **Mecklenburg & Oldenburg(Send Winnig)**, **Saxony(Send Winnig)**, **Brunswick(Threaten the State Commissar)** and **Turingia(R) (Unreasonable Demand)** will be enough to guarantee you a majority

[I made this spreadsheet based on https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/Kaiserreich\/comments\/18kr1bq\/how\_to\_crush\_bavaria\_nullification\_crisis\_guide\/](https://preview.redd.it/an0cva03z3pd1.png?width=1151&format=png&auto=webp&s=213f675cfdbd0dd69f0fdd82d169234b010d905a)

# 7. Production/Construction

**Build civs until late 1937/early 1938**, switch to mil after you have appointed Thyssen and have researched 1938 medium chassis. Just before the war you might want to build up some railroads and airports.

(Your starting fleet is enough but if you want to build up a navy you can build some dockyards before you switched to early mob.)

Put most of your new mils into building 1938 mediums that later could be converted to equip Howizer II & Radio III once you researched it.

After researching 1940 planes in late 1938/early 1939 you can start allocating most of your new factories to air.

**By 1940 you should have 200+ mils, and the majority of your production should go to planes and tanks.**

[1940\/1 Production. Not yet optimised so welcome to give suggestions.](https://preview.redd.it/46nzeawz94pd1.png?width=518&format=png&auto=webp&s=d90b7ec5981e7dc78d3a5de5ce6a9411a3372b14)

# 8. Result in 1940/1

This is the baseline of what you will get based on my test run:

* 1 army (24 divisions) of 30 width tank
* 1000 1940 fighters & 500 CAS, and about 500 outdated ones
* 6 armies (140 divisions) of starting infantry
* 6 army doctrines and all air doctrine and naval doctrines I need.

Your result will depend on your factory allocation and designs.

(The test run is not perfect, and several important techs like heavy bombs for 1940 CAS got delayed for a couple of months. I think I did a pretty standard design for this version, but you may freely change and improve the division design and air designs according to your preference.)

# 9. Other important notes



1. **Always be sending volunteers**. Even drawing a passive frontlines without attacking will earn you enough army xp to finish 5-6 doctrines. but beware too many **casualties will reduce your war support** and stop you from moving up your conscription law.
2. **Always upgrade your spy agency during the start of BM** in 1936 when you couldn't utilise your civs. Collaboration Government is usually not worth it as it will only give 10% compliance and 3% lower surrender limit, but it can be useful if you hate capping Russia.
3. **Always be hosting Summit for Peace,** you have enough pp and war support as Schleicher to do so.
4. **Train your navy and do the ACW and Indochina intervention decision after you have done at least the** ***Second Einkreisungstheorie*** **focus**. This way you will gain the most xp.
5. **Always press for a better Argentina trade deal**. There is a 90% chance of them accepting. If not you can always ~~save scum.~~ Make the survival of Argentina a priority when doing volunteering.
6. Failing a BM turn is not the end of the world, you can adjust your focus to accommodate it, but it's better not to fail.
7. You want Zentrum to align with you
8. The cheapest way to guarantee an **Ireland** puppet is to do nothing until there are 70 days left(there will be a notification), then do 3x the decision that costs command power.","['https://preview.redd.it/3ydto69zt4pd1.jpeg?width=1080&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=27de6847d0bf78df2730d39d4d35130658af98a6', 'Interesting.

Skipping the visa?,0,AmerExit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmerExit/comments/1gpz33z/skipping_the_visa/,1731454970.0,"Hello!

Edit: I think people are confused…my goal is to basically go digital nomad. When I say “look for job” I mean applying to remote jobs for US and international companies.   But some people are saying it’s illegal for me to do even this for a couple months in a country (not as a resident - just a tourist I guess). Maybe I’m in the wrong sub…

I need opinions/advice on what I'm thinking of.  I am a **29 yr old woman** living in NYC.  I got **laid off** a month ago and I was a **teacher in tech**.   I have no kids, no house/apartment, no bf...I really don't have much tying me down.

I have about **$50k cash and another $70k in investments and thinking to blow $30k on the below**.  I have a **passport for Taiwan**/have family there (but I need cold weather/climate change safer places) and speak Chinese.  I would be looking for jobs/studying for TEFL as I travel/etc.  I would settle in a country once I have visa for a job/education or come back to the US.  I was thinking of leaving as per the election but honestly now I'm also inspired to just travel at the very least.  Here was my plan:

\- Employment/Education: look for **tech jobs**, take a **TEFL** course (they are global) in order to teach English (both of these will take 6-12 months to do...an optimistic estimate), go to **grad school** for environmental/sustainability/climate change stuff

\- Housing:  **WWOOF** (trade farm work for housing) so I can get free housing, do **house sitting** (not sure if this is a realistic), pay $1-2k to do wildlife **volunteer work** (which I've always wanted to do) which hypothetically gives meals/accommodation...basically I'd be down to trade work for housing...and I'd prefer to do work in agriculture/taking care of animals

\- Medication: I take 2 medications and it seems most western countries have them...

\- Visa: I was going to spend **14-90 days in each country** and just hop around until I find a place I want to settle in or until I find a job/school that forces me to settle or am forced to go back to the US.  Seems most places don't need visas below 90 days.  Yes I know about the Schengen area.

\-  My top countries: Ireland, Scotland, New Zealand, Sweden...basically the usual countries you see in this thread

\- Etc ( that I also just want to experience or would be ok teaching English there ): South Korea, Japan, Vietnam, Taiwan, Singapore, Costa Rica (and various S American places), Spain, Germany...

\- Budget: I was thinking of averaging out **$2k-3k per month including airfare**?  Like averaging out spending time in cheaper countries and more expensive countries.  I'm so down to stay in smaller cities - I like the quiet and calm...I hate NYC so much.  That's assuming nothing goes wrong/I'm healthy/not money for schooling.

My biggest questions are how do I get phone/wifi plans?  Health insurance plans?

I never thought I'd travel before...and I want to watch at least his initial presidency from afar.  Considering that and my situation...I figure now might be a good time?

Thank you so much for reading.  My parents aren't supportive and I really don't know how to live life in general and I'm low key scared.","['You cannot work on a tourist visa, so you would need a job in those countries who could help you get the right kind of visa to be allowed to legally work.', ""OP, what about Working Holiday Visa?

>""The more things change, the more they stay the same"" - Jean-Baptiste Alphonse Karr

&#x200B;

In 1932, the US was in a crisis. The Great Depression had been raging for 3 years and under the administration of former geologist Herbert Hoover not much seems to be getting better. People are out of work, increasingly go hungry, and live in shantytowns; with tensions only seeming to grow by the day.   As the Democratic party gears up for what looks to be an incredibly easy election, they nominate New York Governor and former Secretary of the Navy Franklin Delano Roosevelt. Accepting the nomination after winning the first ballot easily against Speaker John Nance Garner and former Gov. Al Smith, he delivers an unorthodox acceptance speech calling for an entire reshaping of the country and economy and promises the American people, “a new deal”.

This is the first Point of Divergence. The Depression is slightly worse in TROTL due to further mismanagement under Hoover, resulting in FDR galvanizing the party with his campaign and winning on the first ballot. Having been nominated, it now comes time to pick a vice presidential candidate. Considering the weak challenge the South put forward at the convention but the necessity to keep conservatives who were wary about the New Deal’s programs dealing with unions and social services, FDR surprises the nation by picking businessman and well known Democratic backer Joseph P. Kennedy for the nomination. Kennedy, with a reputation as a very successful businessman and with Irish Catholic roots,  would help the ticket by both quelling conservative and business fears that Roosevelt would destroy their way of life with his new programs, as well as increase Catholic ethnic turnout in the key swing states of Pennsylvania and New York. While some of the party elders are dismayed over their lack of influence on the ticket, they are swept up in the excitement of a united party certain to win and ready to change the nation.

Obviously OTL FDR picked Nance Garner as his VP to quell the South’s fears after the disastrous run by Smith against Hoover. However, considering most of the Upper South already supported Roosevelt and the Deep South would fall in line, and that he only picked Garner because he was still unsure how beatable Hoover would be, I think it’s quite likely he would go another way in TRO. Kennedy also makes sense as a choice, having been a personal friend of Roosevelt for many years with deep Democratic connections throughout the Irish Catholic cities of the North, while also holding well known moderate-conservative views. Therefore, he would be acceptable to everyone and likely would be nominated.

As is destiny, [the FDR-Kennedy ticket wins the 1932 election in a landslide](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/829061416031617095/855699500952453150/unknown.png), sending America’s first Catholic VP and first radical president to the White House. Alongside massive majorities in Congress, things move at a quick pace as in OTL. The 100 Days go as planned, the first New Deal is passed, and although Kennedy is often brought in to assuage conservative fears that the government is doing too much too fast, most Southerners are brought around to the program and begin to voice their support. With their help, Roosevelt is able to go even further than in OTL towards passing comprehensive economic reforms that quickly bring relief to millions of destitute Americans. However, one group has continued to stand in Roosevelt’s way: a conservative majority on the Supreme Court that has struck down most of his more extensive programs, even though they are supported by the great majority of both the people and Congress. Enraged by his efforts to save the country being continuously shot down, and with a new wave of support shown by Democratic wins in the midterm of 1934, Roosevelt announces his most ambitious reform yet: The Judicial Procedures Reform Bill of 1935.

Immediately opposed by most Democrats, a large portion of the public, and even his own Vice President as a ploy to pack the courts, the bill caused the majority that had ruled Washington unchallenged to nearly split. Roosevelt and his liberal faction were insistent that the bill’s controversial language must be in the final text because of the Justice’s insistence on striking down the programs that the country desperately needed, while conservatives argued that this was a giant step towards the Communism that had arisen in Russia. In the middle, keeping his opinions mainly private and only revealed in his many telephone calls with congressional leadership, sat Joseph P. Kennedy. Although he was a self admitted conservative, he was also a very cagey operator who knew how to sense a moment. He could change his opinion at a minute's notice to match the will of the people, and he took great pleasure in lording his superiority over those he considered weak minded and feeble. This is essentially who Kennedy was OTL, especially with his work. When he was appointed the SEC chairman after the Great Depression, many liberals thought the former stock trader and businessman would lead the agency to ruin. Instead, he surprised them all by using his inside knowledge to completely clean up Wall Street and put in many of the reforms that still remain today, while still keeping his core conservative views. Although Roosevelt pleaded with him to publicly support his effort on the off chance it might woo conservatives to his side, Kennedy would politely refuse in order to see which way the wind would blow.

The wind was in fact blowing very hard, but not in the direction Roosevelt wanted. As the bill continued to plod its way through committee, backed by a motley crew of empowered liberals and progressives elected in the 1932 and 1934 landslides, more and more continued to speak out. There were marches in major cities and the Memorial Pool seemed to be occupied by a different group every day. Most stayed peaceful, but as the fears and anger at the bill grew, some turned violent. A large riot in Washington led by former veterans who called themselves the Court Army, and opposed the bill because they thought it meant the end of independent branches of government, had to be crushed by an army division led by Douglas MacArthur. But still, Roosevelt plodded on, much to the unease of his friends and allies who feared the country was now heading in the wrong direction, and that the shoe would fall any day now. Unfortunately, they turned out to be right. While speaking in Miami, the 32nd President of the United States was shot and killed by a man who believed the Court Packing bill was the gateway to Communism. The crowd screamed and rushed the attacker but nothing could be done for Roosevelt, who had been shot in the head twice by a handgun, and who died en route to the hospital. A disgruntled Italian immigrant tried to kill Roosevelt in Miami in 1933, days before his inauguration, on his suspicion that he was a Communist. Joseph Kennedy was still in shock while he was sworn in at the White House after being rushed there in the dead of night to become the 33rd and first Catholic President of the United States on December 7th, 1935.

The Kennedy presidency, having started with a bang and not a whimper, immediately was seized by Joe as the perfect opportunity to make his mark on America. However, although he had big ideas, his domestic affairs were mainly controlled by the will of the people who overwhelmingly supported the New Deal recovery plan. He would not be able to turn the tide of big government as many conservatives hoped he would in order to not risk an even bigger blowback from the nation, but he did throw them more than a few bones. In his first 100 days he withdrew the deadly court packing bill and began slowing down the pace of New Deal legislation being drafted in Congress. This was all that was needed to smooth over the problems with the conservatives who felt that the party was moving too far too fast, while his promises to continue and expand the New Deal, just more slowly, brought liberals into the fold. In order to appease the more radical supporters of FDR, Kennedy supported the nomination of Henry A Wallace for the VP slot for the 1936 election, in part simply to balance the ticket, but also due to Wallace’s great success as Secretary of Agriculture. Kennedy [was rewarded with a massive landslide victory in 1936](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/829061416031617095/856017127541833728/unknown.png) brought on by the recovery of the nation and sympathy for the Democrats after the assisination of FDR. His position secured and domestic matters squared away, Kennedy began to turn to his true forte: foreign policy.

Kennedy knew the place where he held the strongest convictions  is where he could make the most impact: the world stage. Despite his conservative credentials, he despised the ancient empires of Europe whom he saw as exploitative and authoritarian to his fellow minorities, and he held the greatest revulsion for the one that had only recently freed his home of Ireland: The UK. He was especially disgusted by the victory of the Michael Collins led Pro-Treaty forces in the Irish Civil War. As the world crept closer to war, he watched with contempt as the rabble rousers like Winston Churchill called for tough action against Herr Hitler, leading the country into a war he considered to be wholly unnecessary. Although he was a friend of Neville Chamberlain and supported the policy of appeasement, Kennedy began to introduce legislation that would further bind the US to neutrality as well as withdrawing its various economic and military support from the UK and its allies. This was done through the passing of a very strong Neutrality Act in 1937 (“no cash and carry"" clause) and the Homeland Security Act of 1938, which bound the US to neutrality and banned it from helping out other nations with war materials and began withdrawing previous US commitments overseas respectively.

However, stability was not meant to be, for on September 1st 1939, Hitler’s armies plunged into Poland and set off the second Great War in 20 years. In the US, it was seen as nothing more than the Europeans once again descending into violence for land and empire, and both the nation and its president wished to stay out of it. Still smarting over the fall of Chamberlain to the hated Churchill, Kennedy refused to make any deviations from the Neutrality Act and publicly predicted that Britain would lose the war, acts that enraged the UK population which continued to suffer from German attacks. Despite repeated pleas, bargains, and threats, Kennedy remained steadfast in his neutrality even as the population began to warm to intervention, which led to the devastation of England during the blitz due to lack of airpower and other war material.

The freeze between the former friends began to thaw only in mid 1940, when the images on every newspaper of an England in ruin finally began to win the public over. Bowing to public pressure and wanting to butter up the interventionists in the run up to the 1940 election, Kennedy reluctantly supported a modified version of the original “cash and carry” legislation, which put restrictions on what could and could not be sold to support a war, and with the explicit condition that this material not be used to draw the US into any conflict. England, happy to get any support at all, gladly obeyed any stipulations the legislation postulated, but they still remained suspicious of the man in the White House, a feeling that would only grow over time.

Due to Wallace’s radicalism; especially his open denouncement of segregation and supportive statements about Bukharin’s USSR, as well as a scandal over his unorthodox religious views; Conservatives within the party sought to replace him on the ticket. President Kennedy remained officially neutral, but in private supported Happy Chandler. Kennedy had become a mentor to Chandler while he was Kentucky governor. When Chandler, who had long believed that he was destined to be President, asked Kennedy to appoint Marvel Mills Logan, Kentucky's junior senator, to be to the US Supreme Court, Kennedy obliged, and even pressured Logan to accept the nomination. This created a Senate vacancy to which Chandler, as governor, could appoint himself. During his tenure in the Senate Chandler had earned great respect from fellow democrats as well as significant public support due to his bombastic speeches. Chandler used these debate skills, and the strong support of most of the Democratic establishment, to win the VP nomination in the 1940 Democratic Convention. Kennedy would re-appoint a bitter Wallace as Agriculture Secretary once again.

With Germany rolling across France, and Britain facing its darkest hour, the strident isolationism of JPK was increasingly coming under question. To the great shock of many Wendell Willkie, an interventionist, was selected as the Republican Presidential candidate for 1940. He also picked up support from some of the left angered with JPK’s move to the right and dropping of Wallace. The New Deal itself was not highly salient, as Willkie supported JPK’s more moderate plan. This left foreign policy as the most noticeable issue of the campaign. Willikie accused JPK as leaving the nation unprepared for war, and even accused him of being sympathetic to the reactionary forces. While JPK emphasized the need for experience in such times, Willkie effectively countered this by using JPK’s foreign policy related gaffes, most notably when he publicly stated that “""Democracy is finished in England. It may be here.” JPK sought to capitalize on isolationist sentiment, declaring that he would ""not send American boys into any foreign wars."" While undermined by Britain's increased success in the Battle of Britain as the year moved on, Willkie still seemed a great threat to the president. Willkie also ran strongly to the left than JPK on civil rights, pledging to integrate the civil service and armed forces. Concern over Chandler being given the VP nomination, and JPK not promoting African Americans as FDR did in response OTL, led to Willkie gaining a lot more of the African American vote. [The result is a far closer election than OTL, with JPK just managing to win the popular vote and election](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/829061416031617095/856022483677085706/unknown.png). Due to the threat of this interventionist movement, JPK was forced to adopt many more interventionist policies by a party fearful of losing the midterms over the issue. With Willkie’s strong support, the destroyers-for-bases deal, Arsenal of Democracy speech, and lend-lease act all occur despite JPK’s great reluctance.

Then comes the day of infamy: Japan’s surprise attack on Pearl Harbor, which features a few changes from OTL. There will be a long explanation of it released at some point, but for now have the short version. The early battles of the war including Pearl Harbour, the Coral Sea, and Midway all go worse for the USA and due in part to these disasters, JPK and Chandler adopt a Pacific First strategy, much to the chagrin and anger of the English and French. However, despite all of Japanese efforts, they cannot stop the oncoming tide of US naval dominance, and the forces of the IJN and USN meet at the Battle of the Solomons. Japanese losses in this battle, including the great loss of skilled air crew, proved irreplaceable, with the Kidō Butai losing all claim to dominance over the seas or skies.

Despite the delay to the American offensives, the rest of the war proceeded largely the same as OTL until the end, due to the focus on the pacific counterbalancing the 9 months lost. The pacific front is certainly more destructive than OTL, but overwhelming US power ensures their eventual dominance over Japan.

Kennedy follows the 2 term convention, and with the previous Republican nominee Willkie widely expected to win the election, Chandler easily wins the 1944 D convention against Wallace, with most others unwilling to enter the election they view as doomed. Harry Truman is selected as the Democrat VP candidate, due to the hesitance of others to join what they saw as a sinking ship. The Republicam convention nominates Willkie, with Dewey as VP. Willkie was widely expected to win, but shockingly died of a heart attack in October. His premature death threw the Republicans into disarray. Willkie Dewey was chosen as the replacement, with Earl Warren as VP. The youth and inexperience of Dewey greatly undermined his prospects in a time of war, and [Chandler just won the election.](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/829064131042738186/861370722219458570/unknown.png)

By early 1945 Japan had been pushed back to their OTL situation, while the war in Europe still dragged on despite the efforts of the weakened US expeditionary force there. Chandler became obsessed with forcing Japan’s unconditional surrender, in part to vindicate his backing of the Pacific First strategy. Despite the opposition of many generals , who believed that Japan could be forced into surrender via blockade, air bombing , and/or waiting for a Soviet invasion of Manchuria; Hiroshima and Nagasaki are nuked. Japan refuses to surrender in part due to the much more destructive war hardening many to refuse surrender, and due to the war in Europe dragging on which allowed Japan to hope to negotiate a peace via the Soviets which would include the continuation of the monarchy, which Chandler had indicated he would not allow. This desire to save the monarchy at all cost made Japanese resistance fierce in spite of their terrible situation.

With surrender not forthcoming, Chandler authorised Operation Downfall.  Operation Olympic was launched in October 1945, and was immensely bloody, but achieved the conquest of Kyūshū by the end of the year. Tactical nukes were not used due to the reports of nuclear fallout from the previous bombings. In September Germany surrendered, although pockets of German forces lasted until early 46. Operation Coronet then occurred in February 46, and was even bloodier. The USSR then invaded Manchuria in April 46. Facing the prospects of the complete destruction of Japan itself, the emperor announced his unconditional surrender on May 2nd 1946.

Despite the massive casualties in Japan causing great domestic conflict, [Chandler clinched the election in 1948](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/829064131042738186/861357452406030336/unknown.png), despite the victory of Dewey being widely viewed as inevitable, especially with a strong 3rd party run by the Progressive Parties’ Henry A Wallace. Chandler’s next term was spent mainly dealing with the aftermath of the war and the occupation of Japan, which really wasn’t going well. He began to descend into megalomania and eccentric behavior. The Republicans saw their opportunity to finally win an election, and nominated the war hero Eisenhower.

[He won in a landslide](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/829064131042738186/861361963651956766/unknown.png) on a platform of winding the occupation down, and did this by declaring the Republic of Japan in 1950. The rest of his presidency occured largely as OTL, and played a great part in sparking the Cold War. Relations were still frosty with Europe, and the Soviets were already the enemy; so when Eisenhower accepted the entry of the KMT-led China into the US-dominated United Nations, the seeds were sown for much conflict down the line. He did however enact a mini Marshall plan to boost the European fight against communism, called the Dulles Plan. It was, however, funded much less than OTL. On the domestic front, Eisenhower not only desegregated the armed forces, but signed the Civil Rights Acts of 1957 and 1960, after[ winning another landslide in 1956](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/829064131042738186/861359833058902027/unknown.png).

However, the Japanese front was far less rosy. Despite the declaration of the Japanese republic, there were still a very large number of troops fighting the various insurgencies and trying to keep it together. This was mainly supported by Richard Nixon, Eisenhower’s VP and a big believer in domino theory. He desperately didn't want to be seen as a member of the administration that ""lost"" Japan. He supported putting more troops there, escalating matters, hidden bombing raids, while keeping the public face of, ""yes we're definitely withdrawing""; (basically his OTL Vietnam policy).

Eisenhower was content to let Nixon deal with Japan, especially after he suffered a heart attack and stroke in 1955/1957, which gave Nixon great power within the administration. However, as his administration neared the end, Nixon’s dealings were revealed. (Basically the Pentagon Papers). However, Nixon gave the Checkers Speech which defended his actions to the hilt, winning significant public approval in the build up to the 1960 election.

The son of JPK, who is still widely regarded as a good president, JFK ran on a reformer mantle of going back to the moderate New Deal policies of his dad and actually withdrawing from Japan.[ In an extremely close and controversial election, JFK wins the presidency, despite losing the popular vote by 0.2% to Nixon](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/829064131042738186/861360479568658452/unknown.png).

JFK has been president for just under a year as the game starts. He has spent the time focusing on preparing for the US withdrawal from Japan, which occurred just 2 months before game start (1962). He has also started expanding the New Deal, and taking cautious steps towards greater civil rights legislation.

And so hear we are, the actual game itself. [First, here are the factions for each party.](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/829061416031617095/860705842822381578/usa_minister_factions.png) You should note that not every faction is necessarily electable, but most are. And without further ado, [the USA’s starting situation in TRO.](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/829130997819113492/861277676286509086/The_JFK_Presidency.png)

As you can see, America’s situation is very precarious, beset by [conflict ](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/829061416031617095/861384406237184060/20210704181618_1.jpg)and [political division](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/829061416031617095/861385724398010438/20210704184613_1.jpg). However, JFK is confident that he will be able to steer the ship to calmer waters in no time. Indeed he has already spent time working to improve relations with the Entente Commonwealth Organisation, the faction of the UK and France. When in February 1962, Gamal Abdel Nasser nationalizes the Suez Canal, Kennedy is sure that he can bring peace to the Middle East.

However, fate is not on Kennedy's side, as Anthony Eden, UK PM, flat out refuses the USA’s attempts at mediation. Kennedy is forced to respond in kind, and adopts a foreign policy hostile to the ECO; and truly heats up the cold war. (See our [previous leak](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/707650580184694988/835901199571484703/Red_Order_Leak.png) on this topic.)

Despite this setback, Kennedy is still confident that he will fix America.

On the domestic front, JFK works hand in hand with his friend and Vice President, Estes Kefauver. Together, they work to weaken big business and improve consumer standards. [A speech by Estes on such policy is of far greater consequence than he first realises](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/829061416031617095/861380387896950818/20210704181525_1.jpg), for if he gives it, [Estes Kefauver will die of a heart attack.](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/829061416031617095/861380560252174367/20210704181540_1.jpg) The nation[ is in shock](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/829061416031617095/861384949130723349/unknown.png), and JFK [mourns his friend](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/829061416031617095/861380575768084500/20210704181547_1.jpg).

So far we have ignored the elephant in the room: civil rights, which has somewhat been JFK’s strategy so far too. While he has made significant efforts to combat racial discrimination, he has refused to make the moral argument against racism, still wary of Dixicrat influence over the party. His brother and Attorney General RFK has even[ authorised the wiretapping](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/829061416031617095/861387447652843550/20210704181625_1.jpg) of MLK. Such a moderate stance is, however, soon to change.

It is at this point that I would like to give a shoutout to our amazing art team who have worked tirelessly to produce these amazing icons.

Now that is covered, let us return to JFK’s civil rights policies, because they are about to radically change. [The spark that lights this fire occurs in Birmingham, Alabama.](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/829130997819113492/861388797835870208/20210704183219_1.jpg) This riot prompts RFK to arrange a [meeting with civil rights activists ](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/829130997819113492/861389102649704448/20210704183224_1.jpg)to discuss the administration's next steps.

At the same time, events are in motion that cannot be undone -  George Wallace makes his play and attempts to prevent the racial integration of the University of Alabama, personally standing in the schoolhouse door to stop its integration. Imbued with newfound radicalism, JFK issues Executive Order 11111, federalizes the Alabama National Guard, and forces the universities’ integration. JFK then delivers his Report to the American People on Civil Rights, where he finally makes the moral argument against racism and discrimination. The day ends in poignant tragedy with the murder of civil rights activist Medgar Evers. With this new radicalism, [JFK gains a new focus tree](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/829130997819113492/861340729979437056/jfk_tree2.png).

JFK now firmly commits himself to the cause of Civil Rights. In an effort to increase public support for them, he can choose between funding the [March On Washington](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/829061416031617095/861392734622187570/20210704183349_1.jpg), or [speaking at it](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/829061416031617095/861392713331900426/20210704183251_1.jpg).

Then, one sunny day in Dallas, tragedy rears its ugly head once more. JFK is assassinated. I can already hear your questions, or sighs of exasperation; so I will say just this.

The Twelfth,0,ireland,https://www.reddit.com/r/ireland/comments/1e1e6bf/the_twelfth/,1720779560.0,"Today is the 12th of July, which marks a significant date in the Unionism calendar on the island of Ireland, whilst most of us wont be singing the sash and partaking in the celebrations of this day, we thought it might be worth giving a brief overview on the day itself.

Today Orange Order lodges and bands will march throughout various towns on the island in celebration of the victory of King William (Supported by the Pope) over King James at the battle of the Boyne. The war in Ireland would rumble on without Séamus a' chaca (""James the shit"") (who had hightailed it out of Ireland after his defeat at the Boyne) and concluded with the treaty of Limerick.

Originally the Twelfth was a date in which which the battle of Aughrim was commemorated. The victory at Aughrim all but sealed the war in favour of the Williamites. In those days the old Julian Calendar was used, so the Boyne actually took place on July 1st, and was viewed of lesser importance to that of Aughrim. When Ireland adopted the Gregorian calendar in 1752 and with the eventual founding of the Orange Order in 1795, the two events of Aughrim and the Boyne were combined.

Yesterday, on the 11th, Bonfire night is held. On this night, towering bonfires are lit in Protestant loyalist neighbourhoods, and are often accompanied by street parties and loyalist marching bands.  The bonfires are mostly made of wooden pallets and locally collected wood. Eleventh Night events are often condemned for sectarianism or ethnic hatred against Irish Catholics, Irish nationalists, and Irish people broadly, such as the burning of Irish tricolours, and for damage and pollution caused. Some are controlled by loyalist paramilitaries, and authorities may be wary of taking action against controversial bonfiresNot all bonfires are controversial however, and there have been efforts to de-politicize some bonfires and make them more family-friendly and environmentally-friendly. In 2021, there were about 250 Eleventh Night bonfires. A lot of the time Eleventh Night bonfires sometimes involve sectarian displays. Symbols of Irish nationalism/republicanism (such as the Irish tricolour), and symbols of Catholicism, are often burnt on the bonfires. The tricolours on such bonfires may be daubed with sectarian slogans such as ""Kill All Taigs"" (KAT) or ""Kill All Irish"" (KAI). Effigies, and posters of Irish nationalist election candidates, are also sometimes burnt, which has been condemned as ""inciting hatre

The Orange Order was founded in 1795 in Loughall as a result of a sectarian battle known as the battle of the diamond between Protestants and Catholics. The Peep O'Day Boys (Protestants) and the Catholic Defenders fought one another. The Catholic Defenders surrendered. After the battle the Peep O'Day boys marched into Loughall, into the house of James Sloan and founded the Orange Order, which, at the time, was to be a Protestant defence association made up of lodges. Their defence of ""the King and his heirs so long as they support the Protestant ascendancy"" was their pledge.

The Orange Order had a central place in the new statelet of Northern Ireland. From 1921 to 1969, every prime minister of Northern Ireland was an Orangeman and member of the Ulster Unionist Party (UUP); all but three Cabinet ministers were Orangemen; all but one unionist senators were Orangemen; and 87 of the 95 MPs who did not become Cabinet Ministers were Orangemen.  James Craig, the first Prime Minister of Northern Ireland, maintained always that Ulster was in effect Protestant and the symbol of its ruling forces was the Orange Order. In 1932, Prime Minister Craig maintained that ""ours is a Protestant government and I am an Orangeman"". This was in response to a speech the year before by Éamon de Valera in the Irish Free State claiming that Ireland was a ""Catholic nation"" in a debate about protests against Protestant woman Letitia Dunbar-Harrison being appointed as County Librarian in County Mayo. Two years later he stated: ""I have always said that I am an Orangeman first and a politician and a member of this parliament afterwards ... All I boast is that we have a Protestant Parliament and a Protestant State"".

At its peak in 1965, the Order's membership was around 70,000, which meant that roughly 1 in 5 adult Ulster Protestant males were members. Since 1965, it has lost a third of its membership, especially in Belfast and Derry. The Order's political influence suffered greatly after the unionist-controlled government of Northern Ireland was abolished in 1973. In 2012, it was stated that estimated membership of the Orange Order was around 34,000.

The basis of the modern Orange Order is the promotion and propagation of ""biblical Protestantism"" and the principles of the Reformation. As such the Order only accepts those who confess a belief in a Protestant religion. As well as Catholics, non-creedal and non-Trinitarian Christians are also banned. This includes members of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (Mormons), Jehovah's Witnesses, Unitarians, and Quakers. Previous rules specifically forbade Roman Catholics and their close relatives from joining but the current rules use the wording ""non-reformed faith"" instead. Converts to Protestantism can join by appealing to Grand Lodge.

James Wilson and James Sloan, who issued the warrants for the first Lodges of the Orange Order along with 'Diamond' Dan Winter, were Freemasons, and in the 19th century many Irish Republicans regarded the Orange Order as a front group established by Unionist Masons as a more violent and jingoist vehicle for the promotion of Unionism. Some anti-Masonic evangelical Christian groups have claimed that the Orange Order is still influenced by freemasonry. Many Masonic traditions survive, such as the organisation of the Order into lodges. The Order has a similar system of degrees through which new members advance. These degrees are interactive plays with references to the Bible. There is particular concern over the ritualism of higher degrees such as the Royal Arch Purple and the Royal Black Institutions.

The Order considers important the Fourth Commandment, and that it forbids Christians to work, or engage in non-religious activity generally, on Sundays. When the Twelfth of July falls on a Sunday the parades traditionally held on that date are held the next day instead. In March 2002, the Order threatened ""to take every action necessary, regardless of the consequences"" to prevent the Ballymena Show being held on a Sunday. The County Antrim Agricultural Association complied with the Order's wishes. Conversely, notable exceptions to such apparently strict Sabbatarianism may be exemplified by Queen's Orange Society (LOL 1845) parading past Queen's University on Sunday, 26 September 2021 before and after holding their annual service at Union Theological College. This also would explain why shops in the North open so late on a Sunday.

The Orange Order is strongly linked to British unionism. This is a political ideology that supports the continued unity of the United Kingdom. Unionism is thus opposed to, for example, Irish reunification and Scottish independence. The Orange Order has been criticised for associating with loyalist paramilitary groups such as the UVF and UDA, which are classified as terrorist organisations. However, it has publicly condemned terrorism and paramilitary violence. Some bands that appear at Orange marches openly display support for loyalist paramilitary groups, such as by carrying paramilitary flags or sporting paramilitary names and emblems. The banner of Old Boyne Island Heroes Orange lodge bears the names of John Bingham and Shankill Butcher Robert Bates, who were both members. Another Shankill Butcher, UDR soldier Eddie McIlwaine, was pictured taking part in an Orange march in 2003 with a bannerette of killed UVF member Brian Robinson (who himself was an Orangeman). McIlwaine was also pictured acting as a steward at a 2014 Orange march. An Orange Order spokesman refused to condemn McIlwaine's membership of the Order. On 12 July 1972, at least fifty masked and uniformed members of the Ulster Defence Association (UDA) escorted an Orange march into the Catholic area of Portadown,saluting the Orangemen as they passed. That year, Orangemen formed a paramilitary group called the Orange Volunteers. This group ""bombed a pub in Belfast in 1973 but otherwise did little illegal other than collect the considerable bodies of arms found in Belfast Orange Halls"". Portadown Orangemen allowed known militants such as George Seawright to take part in a 6 July 1986 march, contrary to a prior agreement. Seawright was a unionist politician and UVF member who had publicly proposed burning Catholics in ovens. As the march entered the town's Catholic district, the RUC seized Seawright and other known militants. The Orangemen attacked the officers with stones and other missiles. When a July 1992 Orange march passed the scene of the Sean Graham bookmakers' shooting—in which the UDA killed five Catholic civilians—Orangemen shouted pro-UDA slogans and held aloft five fingers as a taunt to residents. Journalists Henry McDonald and Jim Cusack said images of Orangemen ""gloating over the massacre"" were beamed around the world and were a public relations disaster for the Order. Patrick Mayhew, then Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, said the marchers ""would have disgraced a tribe of cannibals"". The incident led to a more concerted effort by residents to have the marches banned from the area. In 2007, a banner commemorating UDA member Joe Bratty appeared at an Orange march. Bratty was said to have orchestrated the massacre.

**Requirements for Entry:**

An Orangeman should have a sincere love and veneration for his Heavenly Father, a humble and steadfast faith in Jesus Christ, the Saviour of mankind, believing in Him as the only Mediator between God and man. He should cultivate truth and justice, brotherly kindness and charity, devotion and piety, concord and unity, and obedience to the laws; his deportment should be gentle and compassionate, kind and courteous; he should seek the society of the virtuous, and avoid that of the evil; he should honour and diligently study the Holy Scriptures, and make them the rule of his faith and practice; he should love, uphold, and defend the Protestant religion, and sincerely desire and endeavour to propagate its doctrines and precepts; he should strenuously oppose the fatal errors and doctrines of the Church of Rome and other Non-Reformed faiths, and scrupulously avoid countenancing (by his presence or otherwise) any act or ceremony of Roman Catholic or other non-Reformed Worship; he should, by all lawful means, resist the ascendancy, encroachments, and the extension of their power, ever abstaining from all uncharitable words, actions, or sentiments towards all those who do not practice the Reformed and Christian Faith; he should remember to keep holy the Sabbath Day, and attend the public worship of God, and diligently train up his offspring, and all under his control, in the fear of God, and in the Protestant faith; he should never take the name of God in vain, but abstain from all cursing and profane language, and use every opportunity of discouraging those, and all other sinful practices, in others; his conduct should be guided by wisdom and prudence, and marked by honesty, temperance, and sobriety, the glory of God and the welfare of man, the honour of his Sovereign, and the good of his country, should be the motives of his actions.

End.

The Grand Orange Lodge of Ireland represents lodges in both Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland, where Orangeism remains particularly strong in border counties such as County Cavan, County Monaghan and, in particular, County Donegal (especially East Donegal). Before the partition of Ireland, the Order's headquarters were in Dublin, which at one stage had more than 300 private lodges. After partition, the Order declined rapidly in the Irish Free State, which later became the Republic of Ireland. Following partition, parades continued to take place in Counties Monaghan and Cavan, but none have taken place in County Cavan since 1931. The last 12 July parade in Dublin took place in 1937. The last Orange parades in the Republic of Ireland are at Rossnowlagh in County Donegal and Drum, County Monaghan, events which have been largely free from trouble and controversy. It is held on the Saturday before the Twelfth as the day is not a holiday in the Republic of Ireland. There are still Orange lodges in nine counties of the Republic of Ireland – counties Cavan, Cork, Donegal, Dublin, Laois, Leitrim, Louth, Monaghan and Wicklow, but most either do not parade or travel to other areas to do so. In February 2008 it was announced that the Orange Order was to be granted nearly €250,000 from the Department of Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs. The grant is intended to provide support for members in border areas and fund the repair of Orange halls, many of which have been subjected to vandalism.

**Facts about the Orange Order:**

* King Billy’s horse at the Battle of the Boyne wasn’t white as famously portrayed, it was brown. A white horse would have made him an easy target.
* Malahide Castle, near Dublin, is the ancestral home of the Talbot family. You can still visit the Great Hall where 14 members of the Talbot family sat down to breakfast on the morning of July 12, 1690. All were dead by that evening.
* An estimated 50,000 took part in the Battle of the Boyne, Surprisingly, most survived, the casualty list estimated at around 2,000 killed. The fighting lasted about four hours.
* Most of William’s army were militia of Dutch and Danish nationality, and they had landed at Carrickfergus before moving south. Aligned to France, James II was warned by King Louis XIV not to face William’s army and instead burn Dublin and retreat west of the River Shannon and hold his ground there to regroup. He refused. He lost.
* William of Orange had a narrow escape at the Boyne. He was almost killed when struck by a ricocheted piece of cannon fire on the foot and shoulder as he (according to legend) enjoyed a picnic and was surveying the battle field on July 11. He was also almost struck by musket fire during the battle by one of his own soldiers during the confusion of battle.
* The first Grand Lodge of Ireland meeting was held in Dublin. Dublin, as the administrative capital of the Island, was the natural headquarters for the Orange Institution and remained such until the Headquarters Buildings, the Fowler Memorial Hall in Rutland Square, was severely damaged in the Irish Civil War.
* The Orange Order’s headquarters in Northern Ireland are based in Schomberg House - taking its name from Frederick Schomberg (originally Friedrich Hermann von Schönberg) appointed William of Orange’s commander-in-chief in Ireland in 1689, now Duke of Schomberg, he was appointed commander-in-chief in Ireland. Hit by musket fire, he died in the Battle of the Boyne and is buried in St Patrick’s Cathedral in Dublin.
* Rev. Dr Richard Routledge Kane (Grand Master of Belfast from 1885 - 1898). Dr Kane not only promoted the Irish language but was a patron of the Belfast Gaelic League founded in 1895 and signed the lodge meeting minutes in Irish.  According to the book “Ulster and Ireland”, Dr Kane said “My Orangeism does not make me less proud to be an O’Cahan.’
* ‘Ireland’s Heritage’ LOL No.1303, which existed in No.3 District within Belfast County from 1970 to 1982, carried a banner with the Gaelic inscription ‘Oidhreacht Éireann’.
* Pope Alexander VIII, ruler of the Papal States, was an enemy of King Louis XIV. As we all know the most basic mathematical equation in realpolitik and war is, ‘the enemy of my enemy is my friend’. It is said that When news of the Williamite victory over the Jacobites reached Rome, the Pope ordered that the bells of the Vatican City should be rung in celebration.
* In March 1933 to hang in the newly-built Parliament Buildings. A canvas depicting the arrival of William in Ireland prior to the Battle of the Boyne was purchased by the government at the time. The picture was thought to be the work of William of Orange's court artist, Pieter van der Muelen. However, it was soon noticed that while the figure in the foreground looks like King Billy on his white charger, floating above him on a cloud is someone who appears to be the Pope, apparently blessing Billy as he makes his way to the Battle of the Boyne. Added to this, the man on foot in front of William's horse appears to be a Franciscan friar, complete with rosary beads. As soon as the picture was unveiled, uproar ensued, with furious unionists asking questions in the House and objecting to the Pope being shown above their revered King Billy. In May 1933, a group of visitors from the Scottish Protestant League were touring Parliament Buildings when an enraged Glasgow councillor, Charles Forester, threw red paint over the picture. His companion Mary Ratcliffe slashed the canvas with a knife. Both were arrested and fined £65. The painting, which was restored, became notorious and was removed from public view.

WATCH: Michelle O'Neill faces ferocious grilling at UK Covid inquiry: First Minister asked why she wiped phone messages despite 'clear' legal advice
By Adam Kula

Michelle O’Neill is facing a ferocious grilling at the UK’s Covid inquiry, where she has been accused of simply blaming others – particularly the UK government – instead of reflecting on her own role.
She was sworn in using a secular oath as opposed to The Bible.

The First Minister of Northern Ireland began her testimony by confirming that yes, she led the country’s government, that she was a leader of her party both north and south, and that she was responsible for not just leading the response to the pandemic but leading by example too.

Having established her senior position in these slow, solemn opening exchanges with Clair Dobbin KC (barrister for the inquiry), Ms O’Neill began with the frequently-cited Sinn Fein line about “public services being decimated with 10 years of austerity cuts”.


A selection Ms O’Neill’s own words were then put to her, taken from her witness statement to the inquiry.

“Blaming others – that’s something you’ve done throughout your witness statement, isn’t it?” said Ms Dobbin.

""The constant theme throughout it, do you agree, is that you blame the UK government for the slowness of this approach in the initial stages of the pandemic: do you agree?”

""I don’t accept I blame others throughout the statement,” replied Ms O’Neill.

""I accept I point out where things are wrong. In particular, I do believe my position is vindicated in terms of the fact Boris Johnson and his government were too slow to act at the start of the pandemic.”

The following was also put to her by Ms Dobbin: “Ms O’Neill, there’s no reflection I think, nor any insight in your witness statement, about any of the hurt or any of the problems you caused by attending the funeral of Mr Storey [the IRA enforcer who died while receiving NHS care in England].”

""I think I have addressed that in my statement,” Ms O’Neill replied, then asked to “address the families” directly.

""You are here to give evidence, not to address people,” came the reply.

Clair Dobbin and Michelle O'Neill at the Covid inquiry, May 14, 2024
Ms O’Neill went on to say of the Storey funeral: “I am sorry for going – and I’m sorry for the hurt that has been caused.”

In 2020, she had said: “I will never apologise for attending the funeral of my friend.”

MINUTIAE OF THE MINUTES:
The handwritten minutes of an Executive meeting just after the funeral were then shown to the inquiry.

These minutes recount that Ms O’Neill had told her colleagues she was “honoured” to be invited to funeral, that he was “a huge figure”, that she knew “thousands would want to attend”, that “people vote with feet,” that there was “no dilution in my mind of public message”, and there was “no offence intended”.

A section of the minutes was read out covering comments made by Conor Murphy (the former Sinn Fein finance minister, who is not attending the inquiry on grounds of ill-health).

That section of the minutes has him saying: “Rules relaxed – not same circumstances; breach of regs – technicalities; I attended, but not in cortege; chapel – soc dist – stewardship…

""People can say what they want to say – entitled to opinion, I’m entitled to be sceptical.”


Ms Dobbin turned to Mrs O’Neill and said the minutes showed her to be “entirely unapologetic on July 2, weren’t you?”

“It was immediately after the funeral itself. I think what I said there in terms of not diluting the public message, that was wrong, because clearly I did – and I have acknowledged that, and have worked every day ever since to regain public confidence and trust.”

She added, her voice appearing almost to break: ""I would never, ever set out to hurt people.”

PARTYGATE ‘HYPOCRISY’:
The chairwoman of the inquiry herself then quizzed her, putting it to her that “wasn’t it a bit hypocritical” to criticise Boris Johnson over ‘Partygate’ given her involvement in the funeral?

""I don’t think so because they’re two very different things in terms of the Boris Johnson approach of partying the whole way through the pandemic and blinking their way through it to be quite blunt…”

The chairwoman interjected: “We didn’t find out about the partying ‘til after the panedmic. What you did was to do something that the bereaved couldn’t do – the normal bereaved couldn’t do – because you wanted to go to a friends funeral.

""Isn’t that then saying what Boris Johnson’s government did was wrong was hypocritical?”

Ms O’Neill responded: ""No, I don’t think so because what I did was under the understanding of the regulations at that time.


""I know we don’t want to open that up my lady but I have answered that.

""But I do accept wholeheartedly that I, in some way, damaged our executive relations with colleagues who had been working very hard with me the whole way through.

“I also accept wholeheartedly I damaged the public health messaging…

""I should have anticipated the outworking of what I did.”

Ms Dobbin then asked: “Was it really that difficult to anticipate the outworking of what you did Ms O’Neill?”


Ms O’Neill replied: “It was insofar as I was concerned on a personal invite attending a cortege of 30 people and I tried not to open this up but that’s the basis on which I attended.”

Ms Dobbin said: “One of the first questions I asked you was whether or not people from Northern Ireland got the leadership they deserved from you: how can you maintain that they did, in light of what you’ve just accepted?”

Ms O’Neill: “I didn’t say everything was perfect all of the time.

""I do believe that I did lead from the front the whole way through the pandemic, as did all of my executive colleagues.

""We’ve had difficulties, we’ve had challenging times, we’ve worked through very difficult times – which I’m sure you’ll want to speak about – but I do believe I led the whole way through; albeit I put my hands up in terms of the funeral itself and how I shouldn’t have done that, because that took away from all the work I’d put in to trying to lead us through the pandemic which was hard on everybody right across society…

""I worked day and night to get us through this pandemic, so apart from this one time I do believe my leadership was strong through the pandemic.”

Ms Dobbin said: “Well, let’s examine that...”

DELETED MESSAGES:
Later in the session, Ms O’Neill was asked if she accepts that she “cleansed or wiped your devices when the powersharing arrangements came to an end”.

""That’s right,” she replied.

""Did you delete them in and around February 2022 or was it later than that?”

She responded: “I’m assuming whenever I left office, yes”.

Ms O’Neill went on to tell the inquiry she would periodically wipe and reset devices to delete personal information.

It was put to Ms O’Neill that, based on the phone records which the inquiry does possess, it was clear that she and Arlene Foster had used their phones to “discuss substantive matters about the response to the pandemic”.

Ms O’Neill said: ""There may well have been the to-ing and fro-ing outside a meeting. All decisions were recorded on the official record in terms of what the civil service hold.""

Ms Dobbin said: “It’s not just decisions that have to be recorded though is it? It’s discussions around them. there are rules aren’t there there’s guidance about what should be retained and committed to the official record.”

Ms O’Neill replied: “...I’m confident all those decisions were recorded. I’ve been a minister for health, I’ve been a minister for agriculture and rural affairs, and I noted other ministers – minister Long – had the same approach as I in terms of clearing your device because of sensitive information before you hand it back to the department because it’s going to be redistributed to another member of staff.”

Ms Dobbin then quoted from Ms O’Neill’s witness statement in which the Sinn Fein MLA had said: “I did not use WhatsApp, text messages, or iMessages to communicate about matters related to the response to the pandemic during the specified period other than logistical and administrative matters.’”

Ms Dobbin added that Ms O’Neill had been given “clear advice that you should be retaining WhatsApps” to which the Sinn Fein vice-president said: “Yes, but I believe I’ve misunderstood exactly what I should retain and thought I had retained everything that was relevant to the Covid decision-making process…

""Firstly I wiped the device, as minister Long explained, because we thought that was our custom and practice in terms of departmental phones being returned.

""Secondly that I believed the official record was recorded and populated.”

Thirdly, there was “a misunderstanding on my part” in terms of what constituted formal and informal communication.

It can be argued that Humanity’s first contingencies for their war against fantasy itself began with the liquefaction of their first aspiring pioneer.



It can further be argued that said contingencies were further - indeed, frantically - elaborated upon with the reception of the first extra-dimensional transmissions from their second pioneer.



However, it was with the breakthrough of exo-reality portal stabilization, and the UN’s subsequent *third* pioneer’s mission and frequent transit between the dimensional planes of Earth and The Nexus that finally forced the government to act, and to act fast; for no sooner did the Nexian intent to make war with Humanity’s homeworld make its way to the ears of those in power did they also make first contact with a vassal, a cosmically-close twenty-five-hundred light-years away from Earth, of the very same polity hellbent on their destruction.



It was with these two shocks - the admittedly greater and lesser respectively of Earth itself being under tangible threat for the first time since the Second Intrasolar War and the UN-LREF, for the first time in its history, encountering intelligent life accompanied by a hostile force - that on 3rd April, 3048, at 1:17 PM UNST, twenty years of contingency planning went into full effect.



*“Plan Arc,”* as GovStation dubbed it, called for the commandeering of every vessel not preoccupied in national security roles to carry out the largest migration in human history, dwarfing even those of the 21st century. “In four months,” official spokespeople repeated frequently, “It is our intent that not a single civilian shall remain in harm’s way on the surface of \[Earth.\]” What this meant, in practice, was the forced relocation of 30 billion people from Earth (as well as billions more from EarthRing, announced shortly before the Nexian attack) in a country that had to move rapidly and without precedent to accommodate them.



While there were substantial fears of mass backlash from the remaining human population over the sudden inundation of refugees into their communities, with many a critic, and even, to much consternation, several representatives in the People’s Assembly pointing towards the European Hate Marches of the 2030s, the outpouring of support and camaraderie from Humanity’s non-Earther populace came as a surprise to even the most optimistic of sociologists. Before the First Secretary had even finished their hasty address on the “Nexian Situation,” hundreds of fundraisers and charity drives had popped up seemingly out of nowhere to support the evacuation efforts. Those families with relatives on Earth, and even those with a single relative off-world immediately sought to reunite, whether that be on the cloud cities of Venus or one of the thousands of stations in the Belt; In one instance, a family was relocated as far afield as Sedna. Extrasolar ventures, however, would prove virtually impossible to come by, with all non-vital traffic to Extrasolar systems having been rerouted to remain within the confines of Sol.



In spite of the myriad of logistical challenges, from transit controllers desperately coordinating the movements of tens of thousands of merchant vessels, to genuine albeit exaggerated fears of Earth’s space elevators collapsing under the strain of evacuees, the approach of Summer saw half of Earth’s population relocated offworld with the remainder to be evacuated by August of the same year.



It was at this point, however, that evacuation efforts were forced to grow in scope.



Twenty-five-hundred light-years from the human flight from Earth, on May 31st, 3048, the Second Battle of the Isle of Towers would be undertaken, resulting in a strategic victory for The Nexus. UN and indigenous forces on the ground, while avoiding total destruction, were forced from key urban areas through overwhelming force. This, however, was not the greatest takeaway from said confrontation; such an eventuality had been planned for, indeed *expected*, given the sheer disparity in resources that both sides could bring to the field owing to the respective accessibility and *in*accessibility to their respective bases of operation.



What truly shook the UN’s military and civilian leadership alike was the Nexian ability to deny UN ships access to orbitals, irrespective of their inability to capitalize on that advantage with a woeful inability to conduct space-space combat: Mana-radiation released 240 kilometers above the surface of the planet Aetheron would disable three warships with all hands lost save one, including the ranking commander of the entire force.



The revelation that low orbit was no longer safe forced GovStation to order the evacuation of EarthRings 1 and 2, adding several billion more to the relocation waitlist, delaying the full evacuation of what was now both the surface and Low Earth Orbit (LEO) by what was projected to be a full month. In addition to this, with the full extent of the Nexian ability to inundate space with mana-radiation, the unprecedented decision was taken to push GovStation, which had been present at the Earth-Luna L1 lagrange point ever since its construction, into a heliocentric orbit, much to the detest of the Lunarians. The exact location of GovStation would likewise become a closely-guarded state secret, not being revealed until its relocation back to L1 in 3050. UN warships, likewise, would be withdrawn into a higher orbital, rendering pinpoint orbital bombardment difficult, if not impossible.



While the seat of the Greater United Nations’ government would successfully exfiltrate from the Earth-Luna system, the same could not be said of the nineteen-billion people that remained on the surface and in low orbit.



For on 15 June, 3048, at 3:25 PM UN Standard Time, the world ended.

**Excerpt from: “*****New Oslo’s History of the Greater United Nations, Volume IV*****,” by Professor Katherine Clarcsson.**



The first Nexian portal to open was to be found in the one place they had previously known the “coordinates” for: The “Portal Room” of the UNSA’s Institute for Anomalous Studies’ Atlantic research facility. Although preparations *had* been undertaken - the room’s shielding had been up-armored with all of the institution’s remaining mana-resistant material, and automated defenses had been established within the room itself - it proved to be little more than a setback for the invading force. While they had been armed with their knowledge of human kinetics from their previous engagements on Aetheron, security feeds show the first Nexian invaders to overcome the installed turrets seemingly at a loss as how to proceed, finding them boxed inside of a sealed-off room wholly impermeable to their magics.



The solution they came across was to re-open their portal thirty meters to their west, placing it outside of the room.



The effects were immediate and disastrous.



While still confined to the atmosphere for reasons that are, as of publication, unknown to contemporary science, mana-radiation from that first portal, barely a few meters in size, encompassed the entirety of the planet at relativistic speeds. Were one to look on from the soon-condemned EarthRings, or even from the surface of Luna, one would see the Blue Marble of Sol instantaneously and violently turn a blood red as mana forcefully and violently altered the light-diffusing properties of Earth’s skies, changing the reflected color of her oceans in the process.



Furthermore, across every nook and cranny of the planet, from the reconstituted Amazon Rainforest to some undiscovered cave of extremophiles hidden near the mantle, each and every *thing*, whether that be a human or Siberian permafrost, that was comprised primarily of organically-derived compounds instantly liquefied.



One could watch in real time as Earth’s geography was graphically altered as the topsoil and subsoil of every continent except Antarctica, now freed from their solid state, flowed as mud towards low-lying coasts and valleys in the largest landslides of any recorded and analyzed planetary body in astronomical history. Global coastlines subsequently “dropped” dozens of meters on average, as millions upon millions of tons worth of silt and sediment pooled into basins, turning what had once been oceans of water into oceans of mud. In extreme cases such as the Mediterranean Sea and American Great Lakes, such bodies were cut off from the ocean and almost entirely filled in respectively.



More gruesome than the fundamental altering of Earth’s geography, however, was the instant liquefaction of all *life*, especially those in the planet’s megacities.



Across every megacity, indeed, every *settlement* on Earth, morbidly-coined “Flesh Floods” immediately inundated Humanity’s beating cultural hearts underneath several meters of the liquefied viscera, bone, brains, and tendons of fifteen billion humans, as well as their pets and any and all other animals, wanted or unwanted, parasitic or benign, who had the misfortune of being on the planet that day, all to the tune of tens of thousands of live feeds broadcasting to the entirety of human space.



It must be said, however, that in spite of 5.95% of the human population dying in an instant, most of the loss Humanity faced was either cultural or, more critically, personnel. Among the latter, including many other lesser points, were as follows:



* The near-total loss of every national government on Earth - Humanity’s Earth-based nation states, the oldest in the entire union, stretching uninterrupted as far back as the 300s CE, had proven to be the logistical cornerstone of the evacuation efforts in their respective localities. Such was the case then, that when the first portals opened, the vast majority of their leadership, legislative, bureaucratic, and military cadres had remained on-planet to save as many of their countrymen as possible. The only of Earth’s constituent states to pull through with coherent leadership were France, the president of which had been on EarthRing, the United States of America, which had previously activated long-vestigial continuity of government procedures, Denmark and the United Kingdom, via Royals that had been off-world, as well as senior government officials of Baltistan, Jeju, Mordovia, North Macedonia, South Sudan, and Togo, all of whom had been conducting welfare visits on their displaced populations at the time of the invasion. The only state of Earth to not lose *any* citizens to the Nexian invasion would prove to be Tuvalu, its territory long-since digitized, and the last of its remaining terrestrial populace having been evacuated a mere 48 hours before the opening of the first portals.



* The Swiss Confederation, at this time solely represented by the ranking admiral of the modestly-sized Swiss Navy, as well as those ships in the Swiss Mercantile Fleet, elected to break 1,233 years of neutrality and declared a state of Total War on The Nexus.



* The total loss of tens of millions of federal and state military personnel - With an overwhelming need to provide order amidst the evacuation efforts, especially after Earth saw the largest riots in centuries when the first alerts went out, millions of UN-A and UN-TSEC personnel and their S-AMCP platforms had been deployed to the surface in conjunction with their local counterparts in an attempt to keep a lid on what was a rapidly-devolving socio-economic situation not seen since the Cascade Collapse. While the human operators had predictably been planned to be withdrawn following the conclusion of the evacuations, the “early arrival” of the Nexians ensured that they, like their civilian counterparts, were rendered dead in an instant. While detrimental in the near-term, the resulting manpower shortage would quickly be made up for almost entirely through volunteer service.



* The loss of senior exo-reality science personnel - With there only being a singular spot in the entirety of human space capable of opening portals by itself, those scientists employed by the IAS remained at their post, searching in vain for a way to prevent Nexian portal openings on Earth. Among those who had remained on post was Director Laura Weir, the senior-most official in the entire institution. It had been through her efforts - whether that be politicking, administration, or research of her own - that Humanity’s first four exo-reality pioneers had crossed the threshold. The loss of her and her team, as well as sensitive information that was only present within the IAS Atlantic facility itself, would set the UN back years in the budding fields of Portal Theory and mana-research.



* The total loss of Earth’s food exports - While “dirty industry” had long since been relocated offworld for environmental protection and logistics purposes, the planet had remained the single-largest food producer and exporter in the entirety of human space, its mass agricultural programs potent enough to sustain not only its population of thirty billion, but the billions-more transient souls of the EarthRings, as well as the nine billion present on Luna. With the sudden catastrophic loss of those food resources, the remainder of the Earth-Luna system almost immediately faced mass food insecurity that the UN had to work feverishly to temper.

Perhaps the only silver lining to come out of what is now known as “Red Thursday” was that owing to the location of the initial Nexian portals - on the Mid-Atlantic seafloor - it took the elven invaders crucial time to find a position suitable for the mass deployment of forces. While recovered records from both the Aetheron Library and The Nexus proper both suggest that this would have ordinarily been undertaken by “conventional” air forces, it is of common academic belief that the recent bloodening of said forces by UN and UN-affiliates during the Battles of the Isle of Towers dissuaded them from what would most likely have been the largest aerial military blunder since the Battle of the Philippine Sea. Instead, such efforts were undertaken via the use of “pilot portals,” meter-wide “portholes” that allowed for rapid visual scouting at the cost of further leaks of Nexian mana-radiation into Earth’s domain. This too, however, was not without risk, as the first two portals, per UN mana-sensors, were both opened within the Abyssal and Midnight zones of the Atlantic respectively, countering further mana-influxes with seawater pressurized to several hundred times atmospheric standard. This, along with the aforementioned location of the IAS facility that the Nexians had first overrun, ensured that it would be a full three days before the Nexian boot ran amuck on the planet’s landmasses.



While still undoubtedly beneficial for the UN’s cause, the wholesale transformation of Earth’s organic surfaces into an unnavigable molasses effectively limited the military’s areas of operation to the urban environments of megacities; while many themselves had seen themselves consumed whole as neighboring mountains and hills liquefied - Liberty and Aeternum, as the Alps and Apennines choked them out, Ganges as Himalayan vegetation smothered it whole, et cetera - many still, especially those themselves surrounded by low-lying areas were spared the worst of the destruction. It was with this, and anticipating a Nexian advance radiating outwards from their Atlantic epicenter, that the UN’s remaining operable S-AMCPs, now controlled by millions of remote operators across all branches, would be concentrated primarily in the remaining megacities of Europe and America. Over the next seventy-two hours, streets would be cleared of human remains, every corner and alley fortified beyond reason, and kill zones laid out for any would-be attacker.



By the morning of June 18th, the first forward units of the Nexian Outer and Middle Guards landed on the beaches of Portugal almost unopposed, with resistance from the handful of S-AMCP brigades that could navigate what little of Lisbon and Porto remained undamaged as well as two droneships being quashed after brief but intense combat. Orbital bombardment would likewise prove surprisingly ineffective, as Nexian units had since learned to keep up kinetic shields in perpetuity while frequently using mass teleportation spells. These same teleportation tactics, when they were not simply using magic to “walk” atop the seas of mud, were used to bypass such terrain entirely, catching the remaining handful of UN divisions on the Iberian peninsula off-guard and seizing Iberia in its entirety by the 26th. Secondary assaults would be quick to follow as the Nexians seized Greenland, Iceland, and Ireland in short order, before moving on to the British megacity of Gem, subjecting it to a brutal siege that would last intermittently for the remainder of the invasion.



To Britain’s south, facing attack from both the Pyrenees and the Channel, the French Republic, partial host to the EF’s transnational megacity of Polis, found itself as the bulwark against the Nexian’s eastern assault. While the UN-A, TSEC, and the federally-commandeered Eurocorps elected to make their stand in the heart of Polis, the French military itself - the only armed force of a UN constituent state that could claim to being independent of the UN’s command structure, owing to the intentionally murky legal gray area it had maneuvered itself into - elected to defend the whole of the ruined country. In a stunning display, fully automated French S-AMCP units would hold the Nexians at the rocky passes of the Pyrenees for a full day, in spite of relentless assault, before Middle Guard units simply opted to teleport to their rears, leaving their Outer Guard counterparts to pin them as they forcefully entered the French countryside.



 **Audio excerpt of an interview from: “*****Tuesday Tonight! Hosted by Ryan Paulings.”***



Paulings: *“Hello hello, good evening everyone, and thank you all for tuning into the Tuesday Tonight Podcast! We’ve got a great guest for you tonight - may I welcome everyone to former French President Jacob Blanc!”* 



Blanc: *“Thank you, I am pleased to be here.”*



Paulings: *“Now, Mr. Blanc, allow us to get right into the meat of things, if you feel so inclined?”*



Blanc: *“Of course. That is fine by me.”*



Paulings: *“Excellent! So! As you know, the fifteenth anniversary of Red Thursday is next week. In order to remind our viewers of the significance of what went down during that desperate scrap on and around the planet, I’d like to ask about the role you played during the whole thing.”*



Blanc: *“...”*



Paulings: *“Of course, it’s okay if you’d rather-”*



Blanc: *“No, no. It is fine. Those few months still, how should I say it, remain ‘heavy’ on me, even after all these years.”*



Paulings: *“Is there anything in particular that feels ‘heavier’ than the rest?”*



Blanc: *“The nukes. Those blasted nukes.”*



Paulings: *“Is it true that you were the one to give the order?”*



Blanc (snorting): *“Who else* was *there to give that order, Ryan? I had to stay on a ship as my homeland turned to muck before me. I had to watch as the cowards who called the shots left my state’s remaining military potential to wither on the grapevine. The* Couteaux *were at the gates of Poiters and Vichy barely a week after crossing the border, and the bastards across the channel were turning Brest into a parking lot when they weren’t turning Gem into a charred smear.”*



Paulings: *“You did it because you had no other choice?”*



Blanc: *“At the time, I may well have been the last functioning iota of the French State, Ryan. The EuroFed, too. Government succession meant that I was left in control of them as well, not that it really amounted to much; the nuclear triad was always ours to begin with, and the blasted Feds had taken control of the Eurocorps, like I said before.”*



Paulings: *“I’m afraid that doesn’t answer my question, Mr. Blanc.”*



Blanc: *“My apologies, Ryan. I suppose, on a personal level, I believed myself to already be a dead man. If that spell hogwash the* Couteaux *managed to throw into orbit failed to liquefy me, the Feds’ own judiciary would have me rotting in a well-appointed cell for the rest of my life; do remember, that I gave my military’s platforms full automation. It was only that debacle with Booker’s EVI that eventually got that lawsuit dismissed.”*



Paulings: *“So you, on some level, wished to take the Nexians down with you, then.”*



Blanc: *“There is more to it than simply that. Do tell: It has been many a year, but do you remember what happened to my country in the Second World War?”*



Paulings: *“Occupied by Germany, right?”*



Blanc: *“Indeed. And the Revolution before that?”*



Paulings: *“You killed your king.”*



Blanc: *“That too is correct. Even if France’s full triad would fail to hold them in the south and west forever, even if it opened the lamp of the atomic genie for every nuclear-armed state on Earth, I could not, in good conscience, see my land brought to heel not only under a fascistic jackboot, but put under the thumb of the very same monarchic tyrants that we overthrew for the very same liberties we hold today. Not when there was something I could do about it, consequences be damned.”*



Paulings: *“That… is something I don’t think we have heard before. But we’ll have to stop there for a minute, as Tuesday Tonight could not operate without our wonderful sponsors!”*



**Excerpt from: “*****New Oslo’s History of the Greater United Nations, Volume IV*****,” by Professor Katherine Clarcsson.**



The French decision to use nuclear weapons would quickly be replicated by their peers in the United Kingdom and United States, the near-simultaneous release of their missiles ensuring that there would be no time to adapt to the coming threat. Across the Continental, British, and newly-minted Canadian and Southwestern fronts, the cores of artificial stars were unleashed upon the unsuspecting Guard, incinerating entire formations and introducing those remaining survivors of the blasts to the horrors of acute radiation sickness. In Europe, at the cost of almost their entire strategic nuclear arsenals, the Nexians were thrown back across the Pyrenees and out of Britain respectively for weeks, opting to wait for reinforcements before resuming their advance. On the North American continent, nuclear bombardments would repulse initial Nexian probes across the Saint Lawrence River in the North and an attempted attack on Lonestar across the Rio Grande, temporarily diverting elven attention into seizing lands further to the west on both fronts. The former would prove a short-lived effort, as the brunt of elven forces in that region would be redirected to assist in the imminent attack on Acela before the arrival of reinforcements, while the latter would meet its climatic end in the American Southwest, wherein the Nexian Vanguard Legion under an elf known as “Caesar” would be defeated by S-AMCPs belonging to the California National Guard in a 3-day long battle at Hoover Dam.



In spite of these localized victories, however, the Nexus continued its inexorable grind towards the total subjugation of Humanity’s cradle. Shortly after the first nukes fell on elven formations, the Nexus retaliated with the long-anticipated mana-flooding of Earth’s low orbit. While the UN Navy and surviving government personnel from Earth had long-since remained in higher orbitals to evade that very threat, billions more would still perish as the barely-evacuated EarthRings found themselves in the crossfire; the only ships the Nexians would successfully disable were hundreds of civilian-operated craft that had been ferrying the orbital rings’ denizens to safety on Luna. The fleet that they hoped to so thoroughly disabled continued to hammer away at their armies as if nothing had happened, forcing their Guards to constantly drain their mana-pools in an effort to avoid death from above. The airships they had deployed in an effort to capitalize on the perceived disruption to their enemies likewise fell like flies, their hulking forms proving too much of a liability owing to their ease of targeting in spite of their superior shielding. The Nexian sky fleets would subsequently be withdrawn mere days later in what would prove to be their only deployment to Earth’s battlefields.



By the first weeks of August, 3048, in spite of total air and space supremacy presenting an insurmountable obstacle against them, the Nexians found themselves in control over a third of Earth’s surface. With tens of millions of Middle and Inner Guards - found in combat to be directly comparable to conventional infantry and Power Armored units respectively - flowing into previously captured territories via portal, and furthermore being relatively unhindered by still-liquid terrain, the UN found itself either in a desperate hold or backpedal across the whole of the globe. In the Americas, the South American continent saw savage fighting in the Andes and the outskirts of Rio Santo as the Nexian Guards threatened to cut the landmass in half. In its northern counterpart, the twin battles of Acela and Brightline raged as the Nexians attempted to breach the American Eastern Seaboard, while further to the west a constant American nuclear bombardment proved the only thing capable of keeping the Nexians pinned in North and South, although forces from the former, by August, had crawled to within striking distance of their nuclear silos. In Africa, a Nexian lightning campaign across the Sahara and Sahel was only checked at Lagos and the Suez respectively. Finally, in Europe, re-invigorated Nexian forces punched back into the lands they had been thrown from, turning Gem into an urban warzone and reaching the outskirts of Polis in mere weeks.



While it would have seemed at the time that the fate of Mankind lay in the robotic defenders of their megacities, nobody could have known that the course of the war would soon be dictated by the hands of naught but three.

“You are certain.”



“Yes, my lord.” The mage-scholar replied, not a hint of doubt staining their voice nor soul. “We have felt its insidious presence from the very moment we first stepped foot within that… *compound.*”



He pondered for the briefest of moments.



Although He was loath to admit wrongdoing, it had become clear to Him that what he had dismissed as a petulant upstart was a genuine threat to the Status Eternia. Not since the Great War had the civilizing force of The Nexus been resisted so, and never in its history by but a single realm.



However, with this information in hand, such costly sacrifices would be paid back a thousand-fold.



He could still remember, clear as day, His battles against the false gods and idols.



He could still remember the one that fled before He could finish the job.



He had found it.



And now that He had found it, he could finish the quest he had set out to complete all those eons ago.



No more would mortalkind be ensnared by the whisperings of animalistic spirits.



No more would the realms fall to ruin.



All that remained towards the achievement of His vision was one last “god.”



One last “god” to consume.



“Return to whence you came,” His Eternal Majesty uttered calmly. “And inform your staff and commanders of my imminent arrival to Earthrealm.”

**The world is** [**running out of water**](https://www.cnbc.com/2023/06/13/water-scarcity-china-and-india-look-the-most-threatened-from-shortages.html)—and economists are worried, especially for the two most populous states, India and China. The world’s intensifying **droughts are affecting industry, electricity, agriculture, direct human use**, and the transition to renewable energies. Experts [fear a **second Dust Bowl**](https://uk.news.yahoo.com/heres-why-1930s-great-plains-122042772.html)—one that could be rolling, and worldwide. But today the stakes are much higher, and the world too complex, to manage the feedback loops. [A Canadian Dust Bowl](https://globalnews.ca/news/9761043/dry-spring-southern-albertan-farmers-zero-production/) may be the first to arrive. South of Calgary, the province has received almost no rain in months. Crops are drying, and dying, and the region’s agriculture may be totally devastated by the end of the month, if drought persists. 

Scientists [theorize that **the Arctic will absorb more heat more quickly**](https://phys.org/news/2023-06-climate-linkage-arctic-subarctic-oceans.html) in the future—and give sub-Arctic oceans less salty water in exchange. The heat transfer will predictably prevent more ice from forming, and **melt Arctic ice faster**. In the Antarctic, super-salty [deep sea water is heating up](https://edition.cnn.com/2023/06/12/world/antarctic-deep-ocean-water-shrinking-climate-scn-intl/index.html), with consequences to be determined. The 21-page *Nature Climate Change* [study](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41558-023-01695-4) is too complex for me to unpack here. Scientists [keep warning about **record ocean temperatures**](https://www.pbs.org/newshour/show/scientists-issue-increasingly-dire-warnings-as-ocean-surface-temperatures-spike) but the people are helpless to do anything about it. 

Climate policy groups are claiming that [**corporate net zero pledges have zero credibility**](https://www.france24.com/en/live-news/20230612-climate-corporate-net-zero-pledges-lack-credibility), even as about 90% of the world economy has (allegedly) hopped onto the “‘net zero’ bandwagon”. According to these scientists, about **4% of such pledges are on the right track**… The findings are explained in a 52-page report, the [“Net Zero Stocktake 2023”](https://ca1-nzt.edcdn.com/Reports/Net_Zero_Stocktake_23.pdf?v=1686526298). 

England’s wettest place, the Lake District, [is going dry](https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2023/jun/14/wettest-place-in-england-lake-district-almost-completely-dry-river-derwent-borrowdale). Some experts are calling the drought the “[next pandemic](https://www.theguardian.com/news/2023/jun/15/drought-is-on-the-verge-of-becoming-the-next-pandemic).” The world is expected to have a **much larger demand for water in 2050**, yet we cannot adequately provide water to even half the world today. Heat waves and drought are [hurting crop yields](https://joint-research-centre.ec.europa.eu/jrc-news-and-updates/severe-drought-western-mediterranean-faces-low-river-flows-and-crop-yields-earlier-ever-2023-06-13_en) in Europe. A similar phenomenon is [hitting Vietnam](https://phys.org/news/2023-06-vietnam-drought-dries-income.html). 

Iranian politicians are supporting [seizing water from the Helmand River](https://ifpnews.com/iran-mps-humanitarian-disaster-east-water-shortage/) between Iran and Afghanistan. A 50-year old treaty guarantees Iran to a certain quantity of water, but drought and overuse has precluded that promise. Soon enough the Taliban will re-learn the **limits of their sovereignty**. 

A cyclone [killed at least 11 people](https://archive.ph/AW4Ec) in Brazil last week. The Spree River in Berlin is [expected to drop considerably](https://archive.ph/trIFY) later this summer. [Heat waves in Mexico](https://www.infobae.com/mexico/2023/06/15/migrantes-varados-en-un-campamento-improvisado-enfermaron-por-ola-de-calor-en-tapachula/) blast migrants and others.

Shell Oil has [committed to extracting more oil](https://www.npr.org/2023/06/14/1182102392/shell-plans-to-increase-fossil-fuel-production-despite-its-net-zero-pledge) in contravention to its pledge to be net-zero by 2050. Aggressive [protests in Angola](https://crisis24.garda.com/alerts/2023/06/angola-further-protests-clashes-over-increased-fuel-prices-likely-nationwide-through-june-update-2) are expected throughout the month, triggered by high oil prices. The UN claims that [**fossil fuels are incompatible with human survival**](https://www.pbs.org/newshour/world/un-chief-says-fossil-fuels-are-incompatible-with-human-survival-calls-for-credible-exit-strategy), but we have apparently chosen oil over humanity’s long-term survival. So it goes.

The world’s [**new temperature records**](https://www.yahoo.com/news/world-breaks-average-temperature-record-165102214.html) for early June, [surpassed 1.5 °C in summer](https://indianexpress.com/article/india/global-warming-breaches-1-5c-threshold-in-summer-for-1st-time-8665570/) for the first time. Marine heat waves contributed to [the death of thousands of fish](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2023/jun/13/visitors-warned-away-from-texas-beach-after-thousands-of-dead-fish-wash-up) that washed onto a Texas beach. 

——————————

Peru has claimed [**over 145,000 cases of dengue fever**](https://archive.is/Qh728) and 248 dead so far. More than [100M Indians have diabetes](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-india-65852551) according to a new study. In a moment of hopeful news, [scientists created a new polio vaccine](https://www.bbc.com/news/health-65860202) that will reduce paralysis and re-engineer the virus into a weaker form.

Cholera [has come to Pretoria](https://archive.ph/DxdZm), South Africa. The illness has allegedly [also reached Russian soldiers in Ukraine](https://news.yahoo.com/russian-units-kherson-oblast-crimea-202400191.html), following the destruction of the Khakovka Dam. The **bacteria may settle in Ukrainian soil** for a long time, expanding the damage of the War into another, lasting dimension.

A mysterious parasite [is killing off sea urchins](https://www.thenationalnews.com/uae/2023/06/13/mass-sea-urchin-deaths-could-threaten-coral-reefs-in-middle-east-scientists-warn/) in the Middle East. **Locusts** [are ravaging crops](https://www.aljazeera.com/gallery/2023/6/15/photos-locusts-destroy-afghanistan-crops-amid-severe-food-crisis) in Afghanistan, which was already afflicted by **severe famine**.

Obesity, another of the world’s accepted pandemics, [irreversibly alters the brain](https://edition.cnn.com/2023/06/12/health/obesity-changes-brain-wellness/index.html?iid=fw_con-hp-10), according to a new study. The human brain loses its ability to be satisfied after consuming sugars and fats, leading to feedback loops of overeating. Life expectancy in the United States [is falling](https://eu.usatoday.com/story/news/health/2023/06/02/us-life-expectancy/70272442007/) due to a number of intersecting factors, and some researchers suggest it has been declining in some measures since 1955. Read the [study’s abstract here](https://ajph.aphapublications.org/doi/abs/10.2105/AJPH.2023.307310) if you like.

COVID: >!I had the opportunity to take a couple flights last week, and I traveled through a busy international airport. Thousands of people walking around and I only saw one other person wearing a face mask—and I confess that there were times in the airport and on the plane when I unmasked for a while, something that would be unthinkable a couple years ago. Yet the reality of (Long) COVID hasn’t changed whatsoever. [The virus endures](https://www.theguardian.com/society/2023/jun/08/long-covid-impact-quality-of-life-cancer-study), even if our discipline does not. A few people asked me if I was sick…yes, sick with the persistent awareness of how a contagious, [potentially debilitating disease](https://www.axios.com/local/seattle/2023/06/14/most-common-symptoms-long-covid) can spread in close quarters. However, every week my masking resolve weakens a bit more: sometimes I go to the supermarket unmasked, I forget to take a mask on public transport, and I am slowly influenced by the madding crowd—and as the world heats up, masking becomes much more irritating. Thinking back to those early years of COVID, it feels like a strange dream, a moment of collective……panic/insanity/clarity?!<

According to one credit lender, [**Tunisia’s creditworthiness has fallen**](https://northafricapost.com/68465-fitch-downgrades-tunisia-rating-to-ccc-confirming-fears-over-economic-collapse.html) to CCC-, as a result of a growing debt crisis, political uncertainty, and stalled talks with the IMF. 

Egypt claims [about **200,000 refugees from Sudan** have entered](https://english.ahram.org.eg/NewsContent/1/1234/502731/Egypt/Foreign-Affairs/Egypt-has-received-over-,-Sudanese-refugees-Sisi.aspx) their territory in the last two months. Meanwhile, Mali is [demanding that UN peacekeepers withdraw](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-africa-65936597) immediately. 

Canada’s population [hit 40M people](https://beta.ctvnews.ca/national/canada/2023/6/15/1_6442311.html) a few days ago, part of the reason why [**housing has become so scarce**](https://www.canadianmortgagetrends.com/2023/06/home-prices-surge-higher-in-may-as-home-sales-post-fourth-straight-monthly-increase/) and expensive. 

About [25% of British respondents](https://www.theguardian.com/society/2023/jun/13/quarter-in-uk-believe-covid-was-a-hoax-poll-on-conspiracy-theories-finds) in a survey claim that COVID was probably or definitely a hoax—whatever that means. Read the [27-page report](https://www.kcl.ac.uk/policy-institute/assets/conspiracy-belief-among-the-uk-public.pdf) if you dare. Only one question mentioned human-caused climate change, and the results suggest at least 74% of respondents believe it is definitely or probably a threat.

**Humanitarian aid is** [**being cut** in Syria](https://www.wfp.org/stories/syria-crisis-food-ration-cuts-set-plunge-millions-severe-hunger), depriving millions of people of food during a difficult year. 

Data centers in Ireland [use 18% of the country’s electricity supply](https://www.euronews.com/green/2023/06/13/data-centres-gobble-up-18-of-irelands-electricity-as-country-struggles-with-climate-target), raising difficult questions about the future. What will our long-term data future look like? Will we have all the data stored on computers, but lack the electricity to access it?

——————————

It was a **week of massacres**. At least [41 people, mostly children, were killed in Uganda](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/6/17/dozens-killed-in-attack-on-ugandan-school-near-drc-border) by ISIS-affiliates. [11 farmers were slain in Nigeria](https://english.alarabiya.net/News/world/2023/06/17/Suspected-extremists-kill-11-farmers-in-Nigeria) and Boko Haram is suspected. Hundreds of asylum-seekers are missing, and [78+ dead after a shipwreck](https://www.aljazeera.com/amp/news/2023/6/16/timeline-how-the-refugee-boat-tragedy-unfolded-off-greece) in the Mediterranean Sea. 46+ people at an IDP camp in the DRC [were killed](https://www.dw.com/en/what-one-more-massacre-in-dr-congo-says-about-monusco/a-65919529) by a militia, using a combination of machetes, firearms, and fire. Ecuador has seen [daily massacres](https://www.plenglish.com/news/2023/06/17/massacres-kidnappings-and-extortions-multiply-in-ecuador/) (3+ killed, according to their definition) for more than half the year. [Extensive damage](https://edition.cnn.com/2023/06/16/africa/darfur-sudan-wagner-conflict-cmd-intl) wrought by Wagner Group in Sudan (backing the paramilitary forces challenging the government) as the conflict unfolds. And the [death toll from a Kenyan cult climbs](https://www.africanews.com/2023/06/14/kenya-shakahola-cult-deaths-climbs-to-303-bodies/) to over 300, as more bodies are exhumed. 

Eight months have passed since Haiti’s Prime Minister [requested an armed intervention](https://www.axios.com/2023/06/12/haiti-gang-wars-foriegn-intervention) to rescue the Collapsed nation from predatory gangs—yet no nation has taken up the call. The U.S. and UN are allegedly trying to put together a multinational force, but nobody is interested. Therefore, **civilians are suffering—and others are joining the paramilitary groups** fighting for control of the ports, people, and positions of strategic value.

A new 90-page [report](https://www.sipri.org/sites/default/files/YB23%2007%20WNF.pdf) on nuclear modernization claims that **the number of nuclear weapons in the world has risen over the last year** by 86, if you believe the data. Russia and China have each developed a few dozen more warheads, bringing the total estimated number of nukes to 21,512—more than enough to destroy civilization several times over. Nine countries currently possess nuclear weapons—and [Iran is allegedly developing weapons](https://news.sky.com/story/iran-the-west-cannot-stop-us-from-building-nuclear-weapons-but-a-deal-is-possible-12900323). Iran claims that their [uranium enrichment is leverage](https://www.middleeastmonitor.com/20230611-irans-nuclear-chief-says-higher-uranium-enrichment-aims-to-push-west-to-lift-sanctions/) to get sanctions lifted.

Europol, the EU’s law enforcement agency, has released its 94-page [**terrorism report** for 2022](https://www.europol.europa.eu/cms/sites/default/files/documents/Europol_TE-SAT_2023.pdf), in which they claim that there were 28 terror attacks (attempted or completed) in the EU in 2022. Italy had the most (12). 18 attacks were considered “left-wing and anarchist,” 6 were “jihadist,” and 4 were “right-wing attacks.” Definitions for these can be found in the full study, which also says that different member states may define terrorism differently. 

Germany released its [first-ever national security strategy](https://www.nationalesicherheitsstrategie.de/National-Security-Strategy-EN.pdf) to the public, and the writing's on the wall. 

>“**We need a secure supply of energy and raw materials** for our country…Our peace is fragile…the **new threats are complex** and affect all areas of state, society and the economy…[some nations are] suffering greatly from ever more dramatic storms, **droughts and heatwaves**…new forms of extremism have arisen that risk dividing our society and **tipping into violence**…Chemical, biological, radiological and nuclear threats pose a risk that should not be neglected…extent, frequency and scope of cyberattacks are increasing…**Climate-induced extreme weather events** with devastating consequences are happening with greater frequency and intensity, also in Germany…**Poverty and hunger, war and conflict**, the impacts of the climate crisis and the destruction of natural habitats pose a constant threat to people…**large movements of refugees and migrants** can jeopardise state security and social cohesion in transit states and countries of destination…the climate crisis will pose a particular threat to **global food security**…” -selections from the National Security Strategy

The European Commission (the executive arm of the EU) is [planning on paying Tunisia](https://www.dw.com/en/tunisia-eus-migration-proposal-turns-a-blind-eye-to-human-rights/a-65906201) if they manage their migration/refugee problem better. And by “better” they mean readmitting people who fled through Tunisia and securing exits through the Mediterranean—in exchange, the EU will stabilize Tunisia’s failing economy. Tunisia will receive migrants/refugees/asylum-seekers, and probably expel them further south.

2022 set new [**records for forcibly displaced people**](https://www.dw.com/en/unhcr-forced-displacement-hit-new-record-in-2022/a-65907732), according to a new 48-page [report from the UNHCR](https://www.unhcr.org/global-trends-report-2022) that came out on Wednesday. You can compare the UN report with the 76-page [2023 GRID Report](https://www.internal-displacement.org/global-report/grid2023/) on internal displacement that I posted a few weeks back. The number of displaced people grew by over 19M in 2022, compared with 2021.

——————————

It’s all about energy. The international project to create fusion power [is way behind schedule](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/worlds-largest-fusion-project-is-in-big-trouble-new-documents-reveal/)—and costs are soaring. Meanwhile, China plays both sides, [**increasing coal production**](https://archive.ph/Sjjyd) while also scaling up renewable energy and [calling for power use to be reduced](https://www.cnbc.com/2023/06/13/chinas-southern-cities-call-for-power-saving-as-grid-stress-increases.html). Some analysts believe that [an **energy crisis is coming**](https://archive.ph/1A88k) as soon as this year, marked by OPEC+ cuts and rising prices of oil & gas. That author predicts a sinking of US shale extraction and declining production from Saudi Arabia. 

Fuel shortages have already [come to Cuba](https://countercurrents.org/2023/06/the-fuel-shortages-in-cuba-are-worse-than-you-think/), and beyond. The IEA (International Energy Agency) released its 127-page [Oil Analysis & Forecast Report](https://iea.blob.core.windows.net/assets/cc7fd38f-3d68-4796-a958-8dfa3f3ef4a6/Oil2023.pdf) for 2023-2028. They predict a sharp dropoff in oil demand starting next year, with 90% of new demand growth coming from the Asia-Pacific region. Africa’s oil production is expected to decline, though Senegal, Cote d’Ivoire, and Uganda are expected to begin decent-size extractions soon. The full report has 100+ graphs & tables, and cannot be adequately summarized here.

Tensions [ebb and flow between Serbia and Kosovo](https://www.aljazeera.com/opinions/2023/6/11/the-west-has-lost-the-plot-in-the-balkans), and western diplomats may be playing the wrong tune. NATO [deployed peacekeepers](https://www.euractiv.com/section/enlargement-neighbourhood/news/kosovo-proposes-5-point-plan-to-defuse-tensions-with-serbia/) to northern Kosovo a couple weeks ago, after [pro-Serbian rioters](https://www.crisisgroup.org/behind-renewed-troubles-europe-balkans-northern-kosovo) clashed with police.

Damage report: about 200,000 archived documents in Dakar, Senegal, [are missing or have been destroyed](https://www.africanews.com/2023/06/10/senegal-invaluable-archives-destroyed-during-unrest-at-dakars-main-university/) following a riot sparked by the sentencing of a political opposition leader. The documents were mostly burnt by Molotov cocktails, and mostly consist of university records, old theses, birth certificates, old photos, and other documents maintained by the university. 

**Ukraine’s counteroffensive** [is yielding mixed results](https://archive.ph/z8Vgd), making gains in some regions and liberating occupied villages. Yet in other places they are losing tanks to **ubiquitous landmines** and Chinese-manufactured drones. Both sides are reportedly holding back their main forces, preferring for now to skirmish and probe for softer spots. Some observers believe Ukraine will soon surround Bakhmut and recapture that strategic objective. Russia [continues to warn about the nuclear option](https://edition.cnn.com/2023/06/17/europe/nato-danger-ukraine-war-putin-intl-hnk/index.html)...

*Select comments/threads from the subreddit last week suggest:*

-There is some kind of discussion on **the future of r/collapse** later today, if you read [this sticky post](https://old.reddit.com/r/collapse/comments/14buq94/open_discussion_regarding_the_state_of_reddit/). I will not be attending, but as momentum builds regarding the future of Reddit, I’m thinking about the future of this newsletter. I fully expect Reddit and almost all its subreddits to survive this political moment, much like Twitter experienced a few months of tumult before everyone basically realized that Twitter was too big to fail—or be killed. Therefore, I expect to continue posting these updates here for the foreseeable future; but if the subreddit is locked on a given Sunday, I’ll post that week’s update elsewhere, and on Substack.

-The United States is getting **super depressed**, based on [this article](https://old.reddit.com/r/collapse/comments/14c1m4m/everybody_in_the_us_is_getting_depressed_cdc_says/). Is it the inflation, political mania, increasing violence, layered psy-ops, healthcare troubles, rising rents, and social media landscape? [This thread](https://old.reddit.com/r/collapse/comments/14a9dc2/how_are_you_all_feeling/) about how redditors are feeling is an interesting cross-section of the community’s state of mind, and it’s not limited to the U.S. 

-What does a **forever crisis** look like? [This thread about Argentina](https://old.reddit.com/r/collapse/comments/14akkbe/argentinas_continued_collapse_by_another_redditor/) falling apart from within gives an interesting perspective on Argentina’s economic problems, and all the downstream consequences.

[Flooding (Prevention and Insurance) Bill](https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/bills/cbill/58-02/0191/210191.pdf)

**Opening Speech:**

Deputy Speaker,

The Liberal Democrats are proud to be addressing a matter that directly affects the plights of our constituents and their local communities. And this is the grave risk that flooding plays. As it stands the United Kingdom has not reviewed its flood prevention and mitigation measures in over a decade. This is unacceptable. Which is why we have brought forward this comprehensive bill which aims to tackle this and more by empowering Government and local communities in mitigating the impact of floods and improving our preventive capabilities.

In Chapter 2, our bill mandates the establishing of minimum standards for new properties, emphasising property flood resilience, flood mitigation, and waste management as key components of proposed standards. This adopts a forward-looking approach which ensures that our homes and businesses are constructed with resilience in mind, reducing the impact of floods on our communities. underscores the importance of transparency in addressing risk management by obligating the Secretary of State and local authorities to make flood prevention and risk data publicly available. A decision which not only aids insurers in accurately assessing risk but also empowers property owners to make informed decisions about flood resilience measures.

Chapter 3 introduces the Flood Reinsurance Scheme. A scheme which is a strategic initiative to promote the availability and affordability of flood insurance. By managing the transition to risk-reflective pricing over time, the scheme aims to strike a balance that benefits both insurers and policyholders. Section 7 outlines the responsibilities of the Scheme Administrator, emphasising efficiency, public interest, and displaying that gradual shift toward risk-reflective pricing. The regulations also ensure accountability through audits and examinations, promoting transparency and responsible financial management. Furthermore, it is important to enhance the effectiveness of the Flood Reinsurance Scheme, which is why this chapter allows for the disclosure of relevant information from Her Majesty's Revenue and Customs and business rates, respectively.

We understand that climate change and other environmental conditions have left key areas of the U.K. naturally vulnerable to flooding which is why it is important we cover this. This is why chapter 4 establishes flood insurance obligations, requiring relevant insurers to issue policies covering a prescribed number of registered premises against flood risks. In monitoring this, this is where we further create a register of premises subject to greater flood risk, a crucial tool for managing and disclosing information about flood-prone areas. As this register promotes transparency, aids insurers in risk assessment, and ensures that relevant stakeholders are well-informed. By combining preventive measures, transparent data sharing, and a robust reinsurance scheme, this bill sets the stage for a more resilient and secure future for our local communities and adapting to the effects of climate change. Which is why we urge the House to pass this landmark legislation in flood risk management.

Criticism of Israel is not Antisemitic,254,Jewish,https://www.reddit.com/r/Jewish/comments/qu4mnl/criticism_of_israel_is_not_antisemitic/,1636939388.0,"We hear this statement all the time, often spammed throughout subs under an anti-Israel video, or during debates. It is accompanied with the notion that calling critics of Israel antisemitic is a silencing tactic meant to hide Israel's crimes against humanity and serve as a diversion from the plight of the Palestinians. The idea that Jews are ""invoking the Holocaust"" to justify persecution and have a ""victim complex"" comes up very frequently. I just wanted to make a post summarizing my thoughts about just how misguided this sentiment is, as an armament to those of you who frequently encounter it. Feel free to criticize or add to it.

1: The level of criticism leveraged against Israel is completely disproportionate to the wrongdoings of Israel. This will often be countered with claims of ""whataboutism."" The reality is, the Israeli-Palestinian conflict is one of the lowest-scale conflicts on Earth. The amount of people who die in the conflict pales in comparison to almost all other modern conflicts, including many that few have ever heard of, and pretty much all the ones that people have heard of. The level of humanitarian crisis and oppressive policy caused by the Israeli government, doesnt match that ongoing in many parts of the world, that again gets very little attention. There are hundreds of ""ethnostates"" in the world and the Palestinians demand one of their own, yet the only ethnostate in the world worth attacking as an ethnostate is Israel. 

The problem with the ""whataboutism"" retort is that the invocation and critique of Israel, both online, in the real world, in student governments, by actual governments, on any single piece of content made by a Jew anywhere on the internet or in a scholarly setting, and down to what people say when they first meet a Jew, is *extremely* *disproportionate,* to a level way beyond people who aren't Jewish can imagine without living our experience. Yes, ""this post is about Israel, stop with the whataboutism"" is a good argument in a vacuum. When every 2 days a heavily upvoted top reddit post is a video specifically designed to portray Israelis as evil, and you have entire news networks, websites, and organizations devoted to diverting all conversation about war/racism/healthcare/financial inequality/trans rights/feminism/video games/artwork to attacks and boycotts on Israel, that argument becomes weaker and weaker.

2: The nature of criticism leveraged at Israel is completely out of proportion to that done on other countries. When people criticize America, or China, you'll find the occasional sentiment that Americans and Chinese as individuals are evil people, but by and large that attitude is shot down and felt to be discriminatory and bigoted. When people criticize Israel, not only is that sentiment *far* more commonplace, but there are *far fewer* people noting that the people of a nation and its government deserve to be distinguished. Moreover, many anti-Israel videos, pictures, and ""documentaries"" posted on hate subs like publicfreakout, worldnewsvideo, etc go beyond criticizing Israel as an entity and are specifically attempting to make the argument that Israelis, as individuals, are subhuman racists, usually through carefully curated interviews or videos of the worst Israelis there are. I've seen plenty of people saying ""well, we shouldn't hate everyone just for being born in Israel"" get downvoted to oblivion with heavily upvoted comments saying that Israelis should be hated for who they are, or actually suggesting that by not leaving their homes and ""moving to Europe,"" they are monsters. Particularly, despite the real colonial nature of many countries, Israeli Jews (and only Jews) are often referred to as ""colonizers"" by default, whether Israel is the only home they've known and their grandparents were refugees, or they are a recent immigrant. 

You can find people literally calling for the nuclear devastation and total destruction of Israel as a state with cheers and upvotes. Mods will almost never actually call these statements out, and people who call them out get accused of being shills and Zionist bots. ***There is literally no other country*** *o*n Earth that gets this intense of an assault onto its citizenship at an individual level by so many people, under the guise of ""criticism."" ***There is no other country on Earth*** that gets its right to exist as a nation questioned, and the reality of it having institutions, schools, research, hospitals, businesses, homes, etc all waved off as ""fake"" and irrelevant as the whole place needs to be dissolved to save the world. ***There is no other country on Earth*** where it is considered legitimate criticism to boycott the language and all the individual people, whether they be musicians, writers, scientists, Holocaust survivors speaking against racial bias, etc, and think barging in to seminars to silence the speaker and threaten the attendees is just ""criticism"" and not at all bigotry over one's national origin. 

3: Objectively, to anyone who knows the history of WWII and the Holocaust, Israel on its worst day does not even *begin* to compare to the systematic murder and torture committed by the Nazis. Palestinians are not being led by the millions into death camps to be gassed. Palestinians are not being enslaved to create Israeli weapons for no pay while being subject to unlivable conditions until they die en masse of communicable disease and starvation. Palestinians are not being mass experimented on. Israel is not waging a campaign of racial superiority seeking to take over the entire Middle East, killing all Muslims encountered, with the goal of dominating the world. There is PLENTY Israel is doing that warrants serious criticism. However, the *immediate* *and unwavering* decision by tons of Israel's critics to immediately invoke Israel as ""the new Nazis"" is telling of a deeper issue. To a degree Nazi accusations are too common across the board, but the use of ""Nazi"" as a label to apply to Israelis or people who so much as believe Israel has a right to exist, is more than just a tactic to achieve a sense of moral superiority, but really a tool to silence and bully Jews by invoking our collective trauma shamelessly.  

Even darker, scratch away at this and you'll often find a sentiment of ""the Jews didnt learn from the Holocaust."" As though the Holocaust was a lesson plan for Jews, where we were meant to atone for unnamed sins and become complacent pacifists that shine love and brightness onto everything evermore at the minor cost of a third of our population being slaughtered. Nevermind that Jews *are* at the forefront of a ton of social justice, charity, and equal rights movements. This idea is so unbelievably toxic and offensive; the people who say this would absolutely balk at a statement such as ""Blacks who commit crime didnt learn from slavery,"" or ""Muslims didnt learn from Iraq to stop doing terrorism,"" but will happily say ""Jews didnt learn from the Holocaust,"" and that ""Jews have a persecution complex."" We did learn a lesson from the Holocaust- no matter how much we contribute to society and demonstrate loyalty and assimilation, we can *always* be centrifuged out from the pack and murdered, under the nonchalant gaze of the world. It was the callousness of the world regarding treatment of Jewish refugees both in Europe and the Middle East that led to Israel's existence in the first place.

4: Jews remain one of the highest victims of hate crimes throughout the world, per capita. We face attacks by white supremacists, Black Hebrew Israelites, Islamists, communists, and everything in between. Yet despite this fact, we are *the only minority* that is regularly told that we either deserve such attacks, or that the attacks are ""understandable due to Israel's actions, even though I don't support them,"" by people who fashion themselves as fighters for social justice and anti-racism. The notion that anything Israel does justifies condoning hate crimes against Jews is pure antisemitism, yet this attitude is extremely popular on Reddit and among various circles in the progressive world (and others). As usual, standards are applied to us that are not applied to any other minority group on the planet. Even more disgusting, videos and documentation of hate crimes against Jews regularly get censored on the same subreddits that post anti-Israel videos every few days. I've seen this happen multiple times. Then when these hate crimes, which in some places (particularly Scandinavia) are dismissed by governmental authorities as understandable, Jews who immigrate to Israel to escape get lumped in as ""colonizers.""   


5: A LOT of criticism against Israel falls squarely into antisemitism territory. The idea that US support for Israel comes from shadowy Jews who control the US government (and Saudi Arabia, and Ireland, and Poland, and every other country whose government tolerates us when the populace hates us). The idea that Jews have no culture or ancestral claim to the Levant and are actually ""Khazar imposters,"" a theory proven wrong through genetic analysis time and time again. The idea that Israeli food is ""cultural appropriation"" which erases the identity of Middle Eastern Jews who spend millennia cooking and creating foods alongside the culture they lived under. The extremely common claim that ""Zionists control the media"" despite intense criticism of Israel by mainstream networks, humans rights organizations, and the UN. The repetition of anti-Jewish tropes about Jesus, drinking children blood, and other classics from the Middle Ages with ""Zionist"" just swapped for the word ""Jew.""  The notion that all of the Middle East's wars and 9/11 and all of modern warfare is due to Israel, completely ignoring every other war and power struggle in the Middle East which have had far greater consequences in terms of casualties. The claim that Israelis harvest Palestinian organs and harvest organs of people in developing countries when they send teams to help in natural disasters. The idea that anything good an Israeli does (ie, helping in earthquakes, agricultural technology, LGBT rights) are specific campaigns to whitewash the inhumanity of Israelis, as though Jews are not capable of being good people or doing a good deed without an ulterior motive.

More important than these ""criticisms"" themselves is the sheer *silence* by the rest of the anti-Israel movement. You almost never see a critic of Israel, such as a member of BDS, call out the sentiments above. You almost never see these toxic attitudes get thrown out of the movement. They are either fostered and championed, or ignored. In an era where we are deciding that silence against a minority is violence, the calculated decision to exclude Jews from this by the anti-Israel movement and then revert to accusations of a ""persecution fetish"" make it all quite clear.

Please let me know your thoughts, and if you find this a good reference next time you debate someone who says ""criticism of Israel is falsely labeled as antisemitism.""","['Wow this was really well written. I personally find the the khazar phenomenon fascinating. Like what a topsy Turvy world we live in where for millennia we were murdered for being Jews even for having a Jewish ancestor, but when we emerge in the modern era with our own strong nation all the sudden we are denied the fact that we are Jews at all. And now we are actually just European colonizers. How bizarre and convenient for the antisemites that we are Jew and simultaneously not a Jew whenever it suits them. I also liked that you pointed out that Jews are making Aliyah to Israel because of hate and then are called colonizers when they get to Israel. What a crazy world.', 'You can easily criticise Israel without being anti Semitic. The thing is, people oftentimes invoke antisemitism when doing so. For instance, I would say fuck that was a pretty shit decision by the government. Whereas others would call Israel the ‘new Nazis’, call us ‘European colonisers’, say the ‘Holocaust was made up’, and that Israel doesn’t have the right to exist for a bad action they took. The vitriol and anger is also unmatched in comparison to other countries', 'Israelis criticize Israel all of the time, that is why they have elections.']",0.008722933589506616,0.47933922195158135,1
